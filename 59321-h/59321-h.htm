<h1>KUTNAR—SON OF PIC</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>Totan, hetman of the northern Spanish
cave-folk, sat upon the threshold of Castillo,
watching a party of men coming
toward him up the mountainside. His
people, to the number of eighty or more, were behind
him gathered about a roaring fire. All were
clad in the skins of beasts and armed with wooden
clubs and javelins. They stared down at the newcomers
with hungry wolfish eyes.</p>

<p>Those approaching from below were short, thick-set
men with hairy bodies and bent limbs—gaunt,
hollow-cheeked and beast-like, and yet men.
They clambered up to the cavern threshold where
Totan and his band awaited them.</p>

<p>In the van strode Gonch the Muskman. All
greeted him in sullen silence, for it was plain to be
seen that neither he nor his companions brought
food of any kind. Totan rose to his feet livid with
rage. He was a giant in strength, a grotesque and
misshapen Hercules, bandy-legged and short-armed.
His head was apparently without neck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
so closely did it set upon his brawny shoulders.
His low forehead sloped to a pair of heavily bone-ribbed
eyes and thick aquiline nose. His big bull-teeth
gleamed from his protruding muzzle. His
bushy brows were drawn down in a terrible scowl.</p>

<p>“No food!” he roared. “Again our hunters return
empty-handed. We must eat. <i>Who</i> shall
it be?” He glared fiercely from one man to
another. All cringed before him like beaten curs.
He was about to vent his wrath upon Gonch, the
leader of the party, when his eyes lifted with astonishment
at sight of something in the Muskman’s
right hand.</p>

<p>“Where—where did you get that?” he stammered.</p>

<p>A look of triumph came over Gonch’s face. He
opened his hand and held it palm upward so that
all could see. There lay a superb flint-blade; large,
well-formed and keen-edged. It was the finest
stone weapon that the Castillans had ever seen.</p>

<p>“A marvelous flint,” said Gonch. “It was made
by the Mammoth Man.”</p>

<p>Totan emitted an astonished grunt. His head
may have been as dense as his muscles, but he could
tell a fine blade when he saw one. Speech was a
laborious process at best and now he could find no
words to say.</p>

<p>“It was in the low country,” Gonch said, pointing
eastward to the rock-strewn plains bordering
the River Pas. “We found a man.”</p>

<p>He paused impressively. Not a sound broke the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
stillness. All held their breaths and waited in suspense
for his next words.</p>

<p>“He was a strange man,” Gonch continued. “He
lay upon his back. The flesh was wasted from his
bones. He gave me this flint hoping thereby to
escape death. I questioned him to learn how it
came into his possession. He said that it was the
work of the Mammoth Man.”</p>

<p>Totan began to find the use of his tongue.</p>

<p>“The Mammoth Man? Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Hetman of a far-off tribe,” Gonch replied.
“Leader of skilled hunters who have prospered
mightily because of him. He makes flints like this
one and supplies them to his men.”</p>

<p>Totan sneered incredulously. “Their leader a
flint-worker? That is hard to believe.”</p>

<p>“The man said so,” Gonch maintained stoutly;
“and I believe he told the truth as to the flints. He
also told lies. Because of them I killed him.”</p>

<p>“Good food gone to waste,” Totan growled.
“You should have brought his carcass here.”</p>

<p>Gonch rubbed his stomach with one open hand
all the time grinning like a hyena. Gone to waste?
Hardly. Gonch was never guilty of such carelessness
as that. He was a prince of cannibals and
his body so reeked with the stench of his man-feasting
that he smelled like a flesh-eating beast.
For that reason men called him the Muskman.</p>

<p>“The stranger lied about the Mammoth Man;
a giant mightier than the Hairy Elephant; one
who has made the beasts his slaves; his home, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
lion’s den; and yet a man who will neither hunt nor
fight.”</p>

<p>“Coward,” sneered the hetman.</p>

<p>“No doubt,” Gonch agreed. “And yet he must
be a flint-worker of extraordinary skill. This blade
proves that; and he who made it can make more.
If he made them for us, our hunting would be a
very different matter. We would have all we
wanted of meat and hides.”</p>

<p>“Aye, that’s true,” said Totan with a sigh.</p>

<p>“What a pity he is not here to make us the fine
blades. Does he live so very far away?”</p>

<p>“Very, very far,” replied Gonch, gazing to the
northeast. “His is a tribe of big strong men who
live in a broad valley near a river winding between
walls of stone. All are armed with these weapons
and know how to use them.”</p>

<p>The hetman looked at the ground and shook his
head. “So far away and the men are big and
strong. Our warriors would not have much chance
fighting them with sticks. I fear that we cannot
secure the fine weapons.”</p>

<p>“Um-m, I am not so sure about that,” said
Gonch craftily. “Even though it be a long journey
and strong men to contend with, I believe that
I can do it.”</p>

<p>The crowd of cave-men stared and gasped.
Totan only sneered:</p>

<p>“You? Be careful with your boasting or you
will be the choice for our next meal.”</p>

<p>Gonch shuddered. He feared the giant Totan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Had it not been for the latter, he would not
long have contented himself with second place
among the Castillan cave-men. It was his brain
against the hetman’s brawn and so far, brawn had
the best of it.</p>

<p>“It is not a question of strength,” he said. “If I
go to the Mammoth Man’s country, I will be only a
fox among wolves. In no other way can I finally
secure the blades.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” Totan grunted. “And so you intend
to steal them. You will get only a cracked head
for your pains.”</p>

<p>Gonch laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>“Steal them? No indeed. I know of a much
better way than that. I will go to the far-off
country and see the Mammoth Man. When I return,
I will bring with me——”</p>

<p>“The flints?” growled Totan.</p>

<p>“No, the Mammoth Man himself. Flints without
him would in time be lost or broken, but with
him, when they are lost or broken, he can make
more.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>Gonch toiled until dusk making ready for
the beginning of his undertaking on the
morrow. His was no small task and he
overlooked nothing in the way of preparation.
Those were days when even a short journey
invited many dangers and privations, particularly
for one travelling alone. Men went about in small
bands as a rule and rarely ventured far from their
caves. And yet knowing all this, the Muskman
was determined to carry out the bold project he
had planned.</p>

<p>His equipment consisted of a hide, a wooden
javelin with fire-hardened point and a flint-ax.
The latter, his main reliance, was his recently acquired
blade bound to a long wooden haft. He had
spent much time upon this his masterpiece. “No
man with such a weapon need starve,” he calculated.
Had Gonch thought otherwise, he would
never have considered making the journey. The
hide he carried was intended as a body covering
when he stopped at night to rest. Provisions he
had none because the Castillan larder was as bare
as a bone. He must depend upon his own hunting
from the very start.</p>

<p>At sunrise the next day, he stood at the cave-mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
fully equipped for his perilous undertaking.
He warmed himself by the fire which burned at
the threshold. This was to be the last time he did
so for many a long day. Fire meant health and
comfort; more than that, frequently it was all that
stood between the cave-men and death. Men treasured
it even more than they did their lives. Gonch
was now leaving his one and only true friend: the
fire that blazed upon the cave-hearth.</p>

<p>Every Castillan was on hand to bid the Muskman
farewell. The children, those which famine and
disease had spared, looked upon him wonderingly.
The women admired. The men had caught the
spirit of this adventure. Any or all of them would
have been glad to accompany him, had he but said
the word. But the word was not said. This was
a one-man project requiring much thought and
care for its successful execution and Gonch would
trust nobody but himself. His was a bold undertaking
which promised rich returns if successful.
He was to see the Mammoth Man in person and
persuade or force that wonderful being to return
to Castillo with him. Once there, he would make
flint weapons for his new masters and the whole
tribe would prosper accordingly. It was an admirable
conception. All that remained was for the
Muskman to carry it out.</p>

<p>As he left the fire, the cave-men pressed about
him to wish him good luck. Totan alone stood
aloof scowling ferociously. He was chief of the
Castillans and Gonch only second man but in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
latter he saw possibilities of a dangerous rival; not
one whom he need fear in single combat but who
might accomplish by chicanery what he could not
do by force. The hetman was saying to himself:
“You have undertaken too much, vain boaster. If
you are lucky enough to escape death in the far-off
country, you will find it here when you return to
disappoint us”; and Gonch was thinking at the
same time as he observed the hetman glaring at
him: “I am not risking my life for you, stupid
pig. Some day you and all the rest of these savages
will be my slaves.” Then he turned away
and clambered down the mountain side while the
men of Castillo yelled themselves hoarse and finally
returned to the fire to warm themselves, leaving
the Muskman to go the rest of his way alone.</p>

<p>His path led directly eastward along the northern
slopes of the Cantabrian Mountains. It was
a strange country to him, once he had travelled several
days journey beyond the province of Castillo.
Its inhabitants—men and beasts—were strange
too and looked askance at the intruder—a lone man
armed with a flint-ax and wooden spear. However,
Gonch led a charmed life. He met occasional
bands of roving hunters, some of which he
fled from and others avoided by concealing himself.</p>

<p>Animals were far more numerous than human
beings. Gonch encountered them everywhere and
at all times, singly and in groups, packs and herds:
horse, bison and long-horned ox of the meadow
lands; moose, boar and stag of the forests; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
various other lesser creatures of field, hill and glade.
As a rule, all grazing and browsing animals made
a practice of avoiding the rough country where
rocks, hills and thickets abounded, for in such
regions all manner of flesh-eaters made their homes.
It was not a fellow feeling that attracted the cannibal
man to the rough country. He felt more at
home there because it suited his physical being best.
This refers mainly to his foot structure. Short
heels and flexible toes were best fitted for clambering
over cliffs and through the timber; not for travelling
hard level roads. And so Gonch sought the
broken region which, although his favorite element,
had its drawbacks, for now he came in close contact
with the prowling flesh-eaters.</p>

<p>Hyenas were too cowardly to attack him and
lynxes, which usually hunted singly, he looked upon
as a fair match because of his flint-ax; a formidable
weapon in the hands of a strong and courageous
man. Gonch was a strong and courageous man
who feared no beast nor human being, Totan alone
excepted. His knowledge of woodcraft, powers of
scent, sight and hearing were a match for any animal.
These gifts in addition to his human wit and
cunning carried him through many apparently
hopeless situations.</p>

<p>A fortnight of incessant plodding brought him
to a broad pass running through the Cantabrians
from north to south. A river flowed through it
to the Gascon Gulf. As he stood upon the bank
of this river, his sharp ears caught the sound of distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
howls coming from behind him. Far away
he saw a group of animals, mere specks racing over
the hills and after him full cry. Fastening his
hide and weapons about his shoulders in a pack
so as to leave his arms free, Gonch waded into the
river and swam across. On nearing the eastern
shore, he made no effort to continue his flight, not
even attempting a landing but remaining in the
water which reached to above his knees. Here he
rid himself of his spear and hide, tossing them to
the bank above his head. Thus free of all encumbrance
except his ax, he rested and made ready to
defend himself.</p>

<p>The howling grew louder and as the fugitive
looked to the west bank from whence he had come,
he saw a dozen or more wolves tearing down the
slopes to where he had first entered the water.
Here the trail was lost and for a time the fierce
beasts were at fault running up and down near the
water’s edge and occasionally stopping to look
across the river; but finally all waded in and the
flotilla of heads came sailing across the stream.
Gonch stood motionless in the water awaiting them,
holding his ax in his jaws and with a stone snatched
from the river bottom, held in either hand. As
the pack came within throwing range, they were
greeted with a volley of stones, one following another
as fast as Gonch could pluck them from the
river-bed. This was more than his assailants had
bargained for. Many of the missiles reached their
marks and the howls changed to yelps of pain. The
wolves of the mountain slopes were a poor lot compared
with their giant cousins, the Cave and Timber
variety, or the Muskman would probably have
been obliged to finally decide the issue at close
quarters with the flint-ax. However, in the present
circumstances, this proved unnecessary. His enemies,
although having stomach for food, had little
for fighting and were only too glad to swim back
the way they had come as soon as they found themselves
getting the worst of it.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Finding himself in no further immediate danger,
Gonch climbed the bank, recovered his spear and
hide and then resumed his journey. Near the
eastern terminus of the Cantabrians, a region of
rocks and ravines, he was obliged to pass through
the lion country. This was by far the most difficult
and most dangerous portion of his journey.
It would appear that the good fortune he had experienced
thus far was about to desert him, for
just when he needed his wits and strength most, an
attack of mountain influenza sapped his vitality
and almost destroyed his power of scent. He
strove to continue but finding the task too great
while the malady was upon him, he climbed to the
loftiest and most inaccessible rocks he could find,
there to lie in his hide-wrappings in a torment of
pain and burning fever.</p>

<p>For two long nights and days, he lay there while
great shaggy lions glided in and out among the
rocks and underbrush, snarling and growling and
frequently emitting thunderous roars, for in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
way it had become known to them that a puny
Trog-man had dared intrude upon their domains.
During the second night of his sickness, Gonch’s
fever left him and he became conscious of what was
going on about him. Above his head was the dark
blue sky and a full moon flooding the country with
its jejune light. Below him, the rocks cast deep
shadows one upon another. Then appeared other
shadows which moved to the accompaniment of low
snuffling growls and he discerned four figures
crawling at the foot of the very rocks among whose
tops he lay hidden. Even one lion would have
found Gonch easy prey, but here were four with
many others no doubt not far distant.</p>

<p>Fortunately none of the animals ascended to
where the Muskman had taken refuge. Perhaps
his scent had grown cold or perhaps his trackers
felt a certain timidity about rushing too blindly
upon one whose very boldness suggested unknown
power to defend himself. When the daylight came,
they went away, thus enabling the Muskman to
drag himself down to where a tiny stream of water
spouted from the rocks. He cooled his parched
lips and aching head and this gave him strength
enough to kill a rabbit by the well-aimed blow of
a stone pitched by his hand. The food gave him
further strength and after climbing back to his nest
and securing a refreshing sleep, he was enabled to
proceed upon his way.</p>

<p>He encountered lions and panthers before he
reached the level country but he managed to escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
them all. He survived hunger and cold. Storm,
torrent, avalanche; all swept above and around him
leaving him unscathed. It now seemed as though
some kind fate had chosen to watch over this evil
man; evil because he had never known good and
whose bold purpose would never have been undertaken
had it not promised to result in his own selfish
advancement. He arrived safely at the western
terminus of the Pyrenees mountains and avoided
the difficulties of their passage by deviating northward
to the shores of the Gascon Gulf then eastward
once more into the lowlands of southwestern
France. This latter was a soggy region watered
by many creeks and larger streams whose origin
might have been traced to the northern slopes of
the Pyrenees. Gonch had a hard time of it getting
past all this; wading, swimming and dragging his
mud-laden feet through bogs and sloughs. After
crossing the Garonne River, the worst of his journey
was over, for between it and the Dordogne, lay
much of his favorite rugged country; broad table-lands,
cliffs and ravines, frequently broken by
dense brakes and groups of forest trees. When
finally the Dordogne River was passed, he adopted
extra precautions and took more pains to conceal
himself, for now all signs pointed to the proximity
of human beings.</p>

<p>A mile or more upstream from where he had
crossed the Dordogne, the river was joined by one
of its northern tributaries, the Vézère. The latter
meandered through a deep rock-channel with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
stately cliff’s and fertile meadows alternating along
its banks. The cliffs in many places extended almost
to the river margin; in others, they lay far
back. The valley between them was but a wide
ditch cut through a limestone plateau with a river
winding through it from side to side. “A river
winds through a broad valley between walls of
stone”; Gonch suddenly recalled the stranger’s
words. He glowed with the excitement of discovery
and gazed eagerly at the distant cliffs which
as much as said:</p>

<p>“This is man’s country; probably the home of
him you have come to see.” Soon he observed a
faint haze ascending above the rocks and so he proceeded
in that direction, following the right bank
of the Vézère or rather the border of the plateau
which overlooked it. Finally his nose caught
whiffs of smoke and he saw white wreaths ascending
above the cliffs ahead of him. Throwing himself
flat on his chest and stomach, he wriggled his
way to the edge of the plateau and peered over.</p>

<p>To his disappointment, he saw nothing, for the
rock-wall leaned outward and he could only guess
what might be beneath. However, there was a
deep rift in the plateau. It was near at hand and
led down almost to the valley, so he dropped into
that and made his way to the outlet. From there,
twenty feet above the ground crouching low so as
to escape being seen, he had a clear view of what
was transpiring in the valley below.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>The overhanging cliff was a rock-shelter and
a score or more men were sitting around a
fire at its base. The fire presented a most
cheering aspect. Gonch could almost feel
its warmth and taste the burning flesh whose inviting
aroma now filled his nostrils. Neither fire nor
cooked meat had been his portion for a long time.
The men of the rock-shelter were enjoying themselves
thoroughly, talking and making strange
faces at one another. Hyenas and wolves laughed
when engaged in unusual acts of cruelty. Gonch
had often done likewise but in his grimaces was
none of the good-feeling that lighted the features
of those he now saw. They were hunters gathered
about the fire and searing the flesh of the game
they had recently killed; all strong fine-looking
young men, warming and enjoying themselves.
Each man’s weapons lay close beside him upon the
ground. The Muskman’s eyes sparkled as he espied
the lustrous flint gleaming from every long
shaft and handle. “I have reached my goal at
last,” he chuckled softly. “This is the domain of
the Mammoth Man.”</p>

<p>One of the band now detached himself from his
fellows and descended the river bank to drink. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was a young man, an unusually young one to be
consorting with hunters and warriors. He was on
hands and knees bending over the water when
something stirred in the bushes above him. Some
beast lay concealed close to where the young man
or boy was slaking his thirst. Gradually its head
and back rose above the green foliage, as a large
panther preparing to spring.</p>

<p>The big cat was in the very act of launching itself
upon the lad when a loud yell made it pause.
The next moment, a man with uplifted ax
bounded down the rock-wall and dashed upon the
beast. A terrific commotion ensued as the cave-men
seized their weapons and leaped to their feet
shouting and yelling. They saw the newcomer
charge into the bushes. A giant cat’s head and
shoulders rose up to meet him and in a jiffy, man
and panther were struggling to the death.</p>

<p>The stranger struck one blow. He could not determine
its effect nor strike a second, for the beast
was upon him. A dozen warriors rushed to his
aid. Something crashed down upon his head
and when he came to, he was lying upon the
ground while somebody wiped his face with a bunch
of leaves. The leaves were wet and red. Men’s
faces were bending over him. The hunters were
jabbering and pointing at the body of a large feline
stretched motionless beside him. “The beast would
have slain you but for him,” said a voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said another—the boy who wiped
the face of the stricken man. “Who is he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“He came from the sky,” spoke up a third. “I
saw him flying through the air. A stranger and
yet his ax-blade is the same as ours.”</p>

<p>The stranger was by this time sufficiently recovered
to sit up. The cave-men crowded about him.</p>

<p>“Who are you? From where did you come?”
asked one.</p>

<p>“He smells like a cave-beast,” said another.
“Perhaps he came here to hunt.”</p>

<p>“To hunt panthers,” the boy laughed. “A queer
odor but what of that? He saved me from death.”</p>

<p>He was a sturdy lad of about sixteen years,
clean-cut and well-muscled. He wore a strip of
rawhide wound several times about his waist. A
skin-pouch filled with large pebbles hung from his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“My name is Gonch,” said the man rubbing his
sore head. “The cave-beasts are my enemies. I
have not yet washed from my body the taint of
their killing. One panther more; what does it
matter?”</p>

<p>Those about him lifted their eyebrows and stared
at him who made so light of his prowess.</p>

<p>“Killer of flesh-eating beasts? That is good,”
said a man, “but he has not yet told us why he
comes here.”</p>

<p>“Who are you to question a chief?” retorted
Gonch scornfully. “I will answer to only one; him
I have come to see.”</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked the man abashed by the
stranger’s authoritative tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Mammoth Man.” Gonch gazed from one
huntsman to another, to see the effect of this. All
faces were now turned toward the boy.</p>

<p>“I can take you to him,” said the latter. “When
you are able to walk, we will go.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Gonch.</p>

<p>The lad pointed up the bank to where a line of
cliffs extended far into the valley. “He lives there;
I live there too. We can go together.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Kutnar,” replied the boy. His face expanded
in a broad grin. “I can show you where you wish
to go as well as anybody, for I am the son of the
Mammoth Man.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>The Rock of Moustier, a truncated pyramid
of buff limestone, was but a portion of the
distant plateau jutting far into the valley
to the right bank of the Vézère River. On
one side of the Rock, a steep causeway of broken
stone led to a broad deep ledge midway between
base and summit. This ledge served as the threshold
of a grotto which opened into the wall back of
the ledge.</p>

<p>Three men all carrying heavy burdens were ascending
the causeway to the cave-threshold, while
above, stood a fourth, waiting as though to receive
them. He was a large man of mighty chest and
shoulders and yet neither overfleshed nor muscle-bound
but fibred and corded from neck to heel like
a fight-trained lion. The newcomers were big
strong men but he who stood upon the ledge seemed
a giant beside them. They greeted him with a
certain deference that marked the larger man as a
person of more than ordinary importance. One
by one they cast down their burdens upon the rock-platform
and squatted beside them. These consisted
of several bison hides, bundles of faggots, a
leg of venison and several large stones about the
size of a man’s head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;" id="illus3">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">“Three Men Were Ascending to the Cave-Threshold”</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>After a hasty survey of the various articles, the
giant’s interest centered upon the stones. He selected
one of them and held it in the palm of his
left hand. This was done seemingly without effort
and but for his swelling biceps, one might have
thought the stone a trifling weight. Using a large
pebble as a maul, he struck the stone a resounding
blow, separating it in two halves as cleanly as
though cut with a knife. The newly fractured surfaces
were wax-like in appearance and of a lustrous
grey color. The giant smiled broadly and nodded
to the three men. He seemed much pleased with
the stones and well he might be, for they were the
finest of beeswax flint. All about him were strewn
chips of similar material; small piles of blanks and
partly finished flakes. Near the cave-entrance lay
many much used mauls and hammerstones of
various shapes and sizes; the tools of the flint
artisan.</p>

<p>One of the three men coughed noisily. Having
delivered their goods, the trio were growing impatient.
They wanted their pay.</p>

<p>The giant set aside the flint lump and hammerstone
and brought out from the grotto a small hide
full of finished flints, all nicely shaped, edged and
pointed. They were of various shapes and sizes,
each one designed for a special purpose; small tools
for scraping hides, knife-blades, dart-heads and
axes. The three men bent over them expressing
by word and gesture their appreciation of every
piece. One of them gathered up the four corners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the hide and swung it over his shoulder; then the
trio descended the causeway to the valley below.</p>

<p>The giant weapon-maker was preparing to turn
again to the flint-lumps when he caught sight of
two figures making their way up the causeway toward
him. The giant smiled upon one of them—a
boy—then gazed inquiringly at the other. The
pair reached the ledge. As the unknown stepped
upon the rock-platform, he bent low and laid down
his ax with much ceremony, then stood erect with
both hands raised high above his head. Strangers
with good intentions always behaved themselves in
this manner—presenting themselves unarmed and
at the mercy of them they visited. The boy came
quickly forward and for several minutes spoke in
low tones to the giant, glancing from time to time
at his companion. The flint-worker’s face fairly
beamed as he listened.</p>

<p>The youth explained the circumstances of his
meeting with the stranger, enlarging upon his own
narrow escape from the panther and how his benefactor
had so nearly paid the penalty of death for
the part he had chosen to play.</p>

<p>“Good,” said the giant when the boy had finished.
“Friends should ever help each other.” With that,
he picked up the stranger’s ax and presented it to
him, then led his guest to a fire which burned
near by.</p>

<p>The Muskman’s brain was in a whirl. He had
accomplished wonders in a single day. So long had
he known naught but hostility from man and beast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
that this peaceful reaction from danger and privation,
to say nothing of his recent mauling, nigh
overwhelmed him. He passed one hand across his
forehead where the blood had not yet dried.</p>

<p>“The boy tells me that you leaped upon the panther
from the sky,” the giant now said. “Men do
not leap from the sky however. How and why did
you come here?”</p>

<p>Gonch felt the other’s piercing gaze directed full
upon him. The deep-set eyes seemed to be searching
his inmost soul.</p>

<p>“Mine is a restless spirit,” he replied. “It has
led me through many lands to see strange and wonderful
things. I have been told of the Mammoth
Man, maker of the finest flint-blades the world has
ever seen. Are you he?”</p>

<p>“I am called many names,” said the stalwart
flint-worker with a twinkle of his deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>“To some, I am known as Pic, the Weapon
Maker; to others—but no matter. One name is as
good as another. Yes, I am the Mammoth Man.”
He folded his arms across his broad chest and even
as he looked kindly upon his visitor, his eyes as
much as said: “Can it be possible that mere curiosity
has brought you here—to see me?”</p>

<p>Gonch did not notice the look of those eyes; he
was watching the man himself. Such evidence of
physical health and strength, he had never before
observed in a human being. “I can see now why
they call him the Mammoth Man,” he thought to
himself. “He is a giant among men as is the Hairy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Elephant among beasts.” But all he said was:</p>

<p>“I helped your boy. Perhaps for that you can
look upon me as a friend.”</p>

<p>Pic’s eyes softened. He looked down at the
ground and replied sadly: “Yes, you have done
me a great service. Since his mother died, he is
all I have.”</p>

<p>“Why not get another?” the Muskman suggested.
“Women are plentiful enough. A man
like you could have any or all of them.”</p>

<p>Pic scowled and raised his hand in protest. “She
is gone,” he muttered hoarsely. “None can take
her place; and of this you need say no more.”</p>

<p>Gonch was taken aback by this peculiar display
of sentiment. “One woman?” he sniffed: “Ridiculous.
The man is a giant but a simpleton for all
that. All giants are simpletons.” But now that
Pic had declared himself upon the subject of
women, Gonch prated of the southland; its fine
climate, abundance of game and the strong men
who lived there; painting the picture in such brilliant
colors that he almost believed in it himself.
But in spite of his eloquence, Pic remained unmoved.
Whether he believed or not, he showed no
more than ordinary interest. There was a note of
sarcasm in the flint-worker’s voice as he made brief
comment: “If this is so, why do you come here?”
to which in spite of his eloquence Gonch could find
no ready answer.</p>

<p>The latter took another tack. “Men say that
you are a mighty hunter,” he began; “and that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
scorn such small game as the ox and bison, reserving
your great strength for the Lion and Hairy
Elephant.”</p>

<p>Pic’s nostrils swelled. There was a sinister
glitter in his eyes as he directed them full upon his
guest. “Who says that?” he growled. Then
without waiting for a reply, he added: “Men who
are wise, do not speak to me of the Lion and Mammoth
in the same breath.”</p>

<p>“Agh, I forgot,” muttered Gonch completely
abashed. “It was of another they spoke. You are
a flint-worker who neither hunts nor fights.”</p>

<p>Pic scowled at this impudence and was on the
point of replying angrily, when he checked himself
as a thought suddenly occurred to him.</p>

<p>“Hunt? fight?” he said sternly: “It is well
that you reminded me. You are a stranger here
and should know our rules. Listen to them and
heed them well for it is quite necessary that they be
most carefully observed.”</p>

<p>“Rules?” Gonch awaited curious. His host
now spoke in a tone of authority and yet he had
mentioned “ours.” A chieftain would have said
“my rules.”</p>

<p>“There are three of these rules,” said Pic in his
most impressive manner, holding up three fingers
by way of illustration. “The first concerns our
young men. It is not permitted for them to do
any unnecessary quarrelling among themselves.
If they should quarrel, it must be a fair fight and
for some good reason.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“He must be joking,” thought Gonch. “No
fighting? Whoever heard of such a thing?”</p>

<p>“Our second rule is equally simple,” Pic went
on. “Also equally important. There must be no
waste of game. The valley abounds with animals
of every kind and they are easily caught. We
wish these conditions to continue. Without beef or
venison, we would starve and so these animals
should neither be alarmed nor driven away. Promiscuous
slaughter is therefore forbidden. Men
must not kill more than they need.”</p>

<p>Gonch gasped as the true meaning of this
astounding utterance forced itself upon him. The
motive that inspired it and its sound logic were too
lofty for his understanding or appreciation. Had
Gonch not been born hungry and hungered all his
life, he might have understood, for his wits were as
keen as those of a fox. But killing was his primary
instinct. His every thought and act sprang from
his unquenchable blood-lust. “Simple rules indeed
and a simpleton who says them,” he sneered
under his breath. “This Pic has gone crazy with his
flint-working. No wonder his people put him here
by himself where he can do no harm.”</p>

<p>But outwardly, Gonch appeared only an attentive
listener. “Good,” he said, “I understand.
These are your hetman’s orders.”</p>

<p>“Yes, our hetman’s orders.”</p>

<p>“And this hetman, who is he?” asked Gonch.</p>

<p>“You will know him in good time,” was the reply.
“You will also learn that he is a man not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
be trifled with. And now for our third rule, an
important one which you must be sure to remember.
Of all animals, the Mammoth and Woolly Rhinoceros
are absolutely immune. No man shall hunt,
harm or annoy them in any way. The penalty is
death.”</p>

<p>This was too much. The Muskman laughed
like a hyena in Pic’s face. “Death no doubt,” he
sneered. “Those two animals can take good care
of themselves. But you have forgotten one; there
is a third.”</p>

<p>“What?” demanded Pic, his eyes blazing.</p>

<p>“The Cave Lion. No fool would——” and then
Gonch wished he could have swallowed his words
before he said them, for the giant flint-worker’s
face fairly flamed with terrible rage. He thrust
his great head forward and bared his teeth in the
Muskman’s face. He extended his right arm.
Gonch felt the huge hand closing like a vise upon
his wrist. An ounce more pressure would have
meant crushed and broken bones. He cowered
sick with terror as the threatening jaws opened
wide as though to tear his throat.</p>

<p>“Meddler!” roared Pic. “Kill the Cave Lion
if you can or let him kill you; either way, it would
be good riddance; but the other two beasts are my
friends—friends, do you hear? If you dare disobey
my commands and harm one of them, I will
tear you to pieces with my teeth and hands.”</p>

<p>He released his grip upon the Muskman as he
said this. His face relapsed into its former calmness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and the storm-wrath rolled away as quickly
as it had come.</p>

<p>“You saved my boy,” he said in a voice so gentle
that Gonch stared at him amazed at the sudden
change. “I am not ungrateful and will treat you
as a friend, provided you do not break our rules.
Be wise; observe them and all will be well.
Enough; we now understand each other.” With
that he turned away and busied himself with the
fire. So completely had his former tranquillity returned,
that when the boy Kutnar who had been
dozing all this time, awakened, his father and
guest appeared on such good terms, he had not the
slightest suspicion of anything unusual having happened
while he slept.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p>Pic had become engrossed in his flint-lumps,
so Gonch stretched himself out by the fire
and gazed dreamily at the smoke-wreaths.
Gradually his eyes closed, his head pillowed
itself upon his arm and he passed away into dreamland.</p>

<p>Gonch was sound asleep; but a hot coal fallen uncomfortably
close to his foot, awakened him. As
he opened his eyes, the first thing they met was the
broad back of his host squatting by the fire.
Kutnar had disappeared.</p>

<p>Pic scarcely moved. He sat with back slightly
turned so that Gonch could see most of his left arm
but not his right. Several large flint-flakes lay on
the rock at his feet. Now he paused in his work
to examine that which he held in his left hand,
raising it so that Gonch could see. It was a flint-flake
similar to those lying upon the rock. He
wondered what Pic held in his other hand.</p>

<p>Click, click; Gonch heard the impact of something
on flint. “The new method of weapon-making,”
dawned full upon him. “It would be well
for me to know it.” He raised himself upon one
elbow and craned his neck to secure a better view.
At the almost imperceptible sound he made, Pic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
turned his head, whereupon Gonch settled back
quickly and closed his eyes. Pic looked at him
sharply for an instant, then resumed his work and
again Gonch was straining to catch a glimpse of
what his host was doing.</p>

<p>The big flint-worker held a small tool in his right
hand. With this he was peeking at the flake held
in his left. His arms were rigid; his hands barely
moved; but the tiny flint chips flew like flakes of
snow beneath the pressure of the retouching tool.
Still supporting himself by one elbow, Gonch
dragged himself closer. He was intent upon
catching a glimpse of that which Pic held in his
right hand, otherwise he would have noticed the
flint-worker’s left eye, now directed at the man who
had changed his position by the fire and was playing
the part of a spy. Pic coughed audibly and
made much ado about rising to his feet whereupon
the eavesdropper settled back quickly to his former
recumbent position and breathed noisily like one
sound asleep.</p>

<p>The giant flint-worker turned and stood over
the sleeping man. His right hand was tightly
clenched, concealing what might be within it.
Gonch neither moved nor opened his eyes. Had
he been—or rather appeared—wide awake, doubtless
Pic would have greeted him with a smile.
Mere curiosity is not an evil trait nor does it arouse
mistrust. But this curiosity which dissembled,
aroused Pic’s misgivings. “Why—why did this
man come here?” he asked himself as he gazed down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
upon him whose sleep he knew was but a sham.
His nostrils twitched as they caught a strange
scent, the scent of the man-eater. His eyes stared
at the recumbent figure. Nose and eyes gave answer:
“Why did he come? Who knows? But we
mistrust this trickster who so reeks with carrion.
He will bear watching.”</p>

<p>Pic turned away, whereupon Gonch yawned
loudly, stretched his limbs and sat up, chuckling
at his own cleverness. He was about to engage his
host in renewed conversation when there sounded
the scuffling of feet and the boy Kutnar came running
up the causeway to the ledge. “Look below;
they are coming,” he shouted gleefully. He seized
his father’s hand and both hurried to the northern
side of the Rock.</p>

<p>Far beneath them, scattered groups of animals
were moving down the valley from the northeast.
At sight of them, man and boy became greatly excited.
They behaved like two children on circus
day, watching the procession and commenting on
the various animals as they filed slowly past.</p>

<p>“The Moose; he is early,” muttered Pic. “That
means a long cold winter. The Lynx; Agh, my
good Stag and Roebuck, you must look to your
fawns from now on.”</p>

<p>A group of long-horned oxen, then a herd of
bison followed with a pack of wolves skulking after
them. A herd of horses passed and several hundred
yards behind them, strode a gigantic deer,
holding his head proudly erect beneath a ten-foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
spread of palmated antlers. It was the Irish Elk.</p>

<p>“A noble beast, the Skelg,” said Pic. “Would
that the valley had more like him. He must be
spared by our hunters and encouraged to winter
here. I will see to it.”</p>

<p>More animals paraded by, many of them grazing
as they went. A herd of reindeer appeared, walking
briskly and tossing their scraggly antlers. At
sight of them, the excitement of the two observers
increased. Kutnar nudged his father and whispered,
“See! the first of the Tundr-folk. The
others will soon be here.”</p>

<p>Pic made no answer; but his whole body trembled
and his eyes were straining for a better view of
two far-off moving specks. Gradually these latter
resolved themselves into two animals, coming rapidly
down the valley. No longer could father and
son restrain themselves. They leaped and danced
about the ledge like two lunatics, laughing and
shouting: “Here they come; here they come!” clapping
their hands and yelling themselves hoarse.</p>

<p>While all this commotion was going on, Gonch
sat an amazed spectator, too bewildered to move.
Father and son had forgotten him entirely.
Gonch was glad of that, for two madmen were more
than he cared to manage. He was collecting his
wits together and preparing for a hasty retreat
down the causeway when he saw Pic put both hands
to his mouth like a funnel and heard him call at
the top of his lungs: “Hairi! Wulli!”</p>

<p>Gonch sprang to his feet and peered down into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the valley. He saw two animals standing there
with heads raised towards the two men high above
them upon the ledge. The larger beast, an elephant,
raised its trunk. A shrill trumpet squeal
floated faintly to the Muskman’s ears. Then followed
another squeal of a different sort, probably
uttered by the second and smaller animal, a rhinoceros.</p>

<p>At the sounds, Pic and Kutnar scrambled downward
and disappeared. Gonch ran across the ledge
and looked over. The two human figures were
rapidly descending the cliffs, lowering their bodies
from rock to rock by the combined use of their
supple hands and feet. Kutnar was as agile and
sure-footed as a chamois and Pic was not far behind
him. So swift was their descent, that it seemed
only a moment before they had reached the bottom
and were dashing up the valley.</p>

<p>Gonch suddenly uttered an astonished yell. He
rubbed the moisture from his eyes to make sure
he saw what he thought he saw. Man and boy
were charging upon the beasts at top speed. The
latter sprang forward in their turn and bore down
upon their unarmed assailants. This was indeed
madness. In a moment, man and boy would be
annihilated.</p>

<p>Gonch strained his eyes that they might miss
nothing of the climax. Such madness was astounding
but he meant to enjoy the sound of dying
shrieks and the sight of crushed bodies while he
had the chance.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Agh-h!” he croaked delightedly as the four figures
united in one mass. He heard squeals, bellows
and much shouting, which from where he
stood, sounded like the noise of battle. Finally
the mass disintegrated into two parts; man and
Mammoth composed one, boy and rhinoceros the
other and each couple was standing peaceably side
by side.</p>

<p>No blood; no dying shrieks; “Agh,” muttered
Gonch a second time but in a far different tone.
“The beasts are indeed his friends,” and he sank
down weakly upon his haunches, wondering where
man’s folly would end and what the whole world
was coming to.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p>Gonch acquired more experience of the
Mammoth Man’s peculiar whims, other
than his friendship for the Hairy Mammoth
and Woolly Rhinoceros. He gained
this when he and Kutnar went down into the valley
together and mingled with the Mousterian cave-men.
The game laws or ban on needless slaughter
of which Pic had spoken, Gonch had hitherto considered
as the fancy of a disordered mind. Now
to his astonishment, he found them not only a reality
but scrupulously observed by one and all, although
he saw no sign of the authority that
enforced them. The Mousterians killed no more
than sufficient for their wants and what they did
kill was used to the best advantage. Nothing was
wasted. The flesh served as food and the hides
were set aside to be used as clothing during the cold
season. Even the limb bones were split open for
the juicy marrow they contained.</p>

<p>It was a strange community, this valley of the
Vézère; too peaceful to suit Gonch. The cave-men
themselves rarely fought or killed each other.
Naturally this put a premium on human flesh, another
drawback from the Muskman’s point of
view; and he blamed it all on the mad Mammoth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Man who should have attended strictly to his flint-working
instead of imbuing the whole community
with his crazy notions.</p>

<p>Gonch learned something more that surprised
him and this concerned Kutnar. The latter spent
most of his time with the men, an unusual proceeding,
for boys were usually left with the women
when the men went forth on hunting or other expeditions.
Kutnar, however, seemed to enjoy special
privileges. He was a strong, active lad, but a boy
nevertheless and Gonch marvelled that men would
tolerate his taking part in their affairs. It must
be that as son of the master flint-worker, he was
an extraordinarily privileged youth. Then, too,
he went about unarmed; so it appeared, for he bore
nothing but his pouch of pebbles and the rawhide
thong wound about his waist. The hunters were
walking across the meadow when a hare sprang up
beneath their feet, bounded away several rods and
then sat bolt upright. At a signal from the leader
of the band, all stopped. The man beckoned to
Kutnar. “Your turn now,” and then as the boy
came forward, all stood at attention, apparently
much interested in what was about to happen.</p>

<p>While Gonch looked curiously on, wondering
what new and strange spectacle was to be presented,
Kutnar unwound the thong from his waist
and held it dangling with the two ends in his right
hand. Taking a pebble from his pouch he set it
in the rawhide’s hanging fold; then with a whispered
“Stand clear” he whirled thong and pebble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
several times about his shoulders and let fly. So
swiftly sped the stone that no eye could follow it.
Gonch could not observe that anything in particular
had happened until one of the hunters ran forward
and picked up the hare, no longer sitting
upright but kicking its last upon the green meadow
grass.</p>

<p>“A chance shot,” thought Gonch who by this time
had arrived at some understanding of this new
method of stone-throwing. Nevertheless the sling
was a novelty and the lad had displayed much skill
in its use. Gonch went closer to examine it.
Stones were usually hurled from the hand or by a
throwing-stick, never from a strip of hide.</p>

<p>“Fling-string,” he muttered scornfully. “It
was a lucky cast. The stone might fly anywhere
except to the mark meant for it.”</p>

<p>But Gonch was mistaken. What Kutnar had
done, he could do again, not once but many times.
Half a dozen more hares and several rabbits fell
before his unerring aim and then the hunters returned
homeward with their bag, for the game-laws
applied to all animals, small as well as large
and what they or rather Kutnar had killed was sufficient
for their immediate needs. On the way
back, Gonch’s opinion of Kutnar and his sling had
undergone a profound change. It was a boy’s
weapon but one which a grown man could respect.
The youth’s skill with it was beyond the stretch
of one’s imagination. “The lad is a marvel,”
thought Gonch. “He has killed enough food for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
dozen men,” and he had a wholesome respect after
that, not only for the fling-string as he called it,
but the arm and eye that could send the pebble so
straight and swiftly to its mark.</p>

<p>But the most amazing thing of all, he was to discover
when he found how intimate Kutnar was
with the friendly Mammoth and Rhinoceros. He
heard Kutnar one day jabbering away to the two,
apparently in response to their squeals and grunts.</p>

<p>“Why do you make those noises?” asked Gonch.</p>

<p>“Wulli and Hairi don’t know the man-language
but I know theirs. My father taught it to me and
we can understand each other perfectly,” explained
the boy.</p>

<p>The two animals were quite at home in the valley,
for the Mousterian hunters left them severely
alone. It was evident that men and beasts had
arrived at some understanding. They were a
strange pair, were the two beasts, grand surviving
relics of an ancient order of things. The Mammoth
was a giant nearly ten feet tall from sole to
shoulder hump. He wore a long-haired overcoat
underlain by closely packed wool. The Rhinoceros
was similarly clad. In the matter of clothing they
much resembled each other, also both of them were
arctic animals, sometimes called Tundr-folk because
of their homes in the bleak unforested tundras
of northern Russia and Siberia.</p>

<p>Pic the Weapon Maker was usually to be found
squatting upon the cave-threshold, making tools
and weapons from the flint his people brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
him. They also brought food and other necessities
and received finished flint weapons in exchange.
Gonch looked upon this manner of trading as a remarkable
arrangement. He could almost see Pic
sitting apart from the other men, on the threshold
of Castillo, making and handing out superb blades
while lines of hunters ascended the mountain side,
all laden with freshly-killed game. Totan did not
figure in this day dream, for he had been disposed
of and Gonch himself had taken his place. It was a
beautifully drawn picture, all woven about the
Mousterian flint-worker but it contained one jarring
note, which dream as he would, the Muskman
could not obliterate. Pic in repose was an angel;
aroused, a demon. That terrible face and the iron
grip upon his wrist were things that Gonch could
not forget, try as he would. “We can tie him up
when he has his crazy fits,” he thought and although
this seemed a good way of remedying the difficulty,
it did not drive away the dark cloud entirely.</p>

<p>Gonch saw much of Pic’s weapon-making, but
spy as he would, he could not catch him working
with that little tool he had partially observed when
lying by the fire during the occasion of his first
visit to Moustier. Whenever his guest appeared,
Pic put away his tool and worked entirely with the
hammerstone, changing to ones of smaller size and
less weight during the progress of the work from
the hewn blank to the semi-finished flake. His
skill with the stone-maul was uncanny. Gonch
marvelled at the deft strokes, forever varying in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
force and direction but each one striking just right
to remove each chip from its place and properly
shape the blade. But none of the weapons he saw
made, ever quite reached the completed stage. Pic
jealously guarded the retouching tool from
Gonch’s sight and scheme as the latter would, he
could not catch a glimpse of it.</p>

<p>Gonch felt that he was losing rather than gaining
ground with the Mammoth Man. He realized
the importance of winning the latter’s confidence
and of being in a position to offer inducements
before he could hope to arrange the long journey
to the southland. And so he flattered his host,
joked with him and painted pictures of Castillo in
glowing colors; to all of which Pic would say: “If
these things are so, why do you, a southron, leave
them and come here?” or else he would hold his
peace and appear more interested in his flint-hammering
than in what the Muskman was descanting;
and finally when he scowled and glared at his
guest, Gonch knew it was time to take himself off.</p>

<p>It was after one of these parleys when he had
gone down into the valley, with bitterness in his
heart against all the world in general and the Mammoth
Man in particular, that he scaled the cliffs to
the plateau above in order to be alone and scheme
anew. When he reached the upper level, he snarled
angrily for the plateau was as flat and smooth as
a board. Several hundred yards distant, a huge
boulder rested at the very edge of the cliff, so
Gonch went to that and sat down with his back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
it, safe from spying and interruption. It trembled
as he touched it; a huge stone of many tons
weight and yet it moved with the mere touch of his
shoulders. It had been long since any man dared
to go near this eerie boulder which rocked with the
wind. Some said that a giant flesh-eating beast
had long been sealed within it and that it struggled
to escape when the wind blew. So they gave it a
wide berth but Gonch, having neither seen nor
heard of it before, considered it a mere rock. Here
was a good place to seclude himself and so he
crouched with his back to it and to the valley below
him. He tried to think and plan but with his slightest
motion, the boulder teetered from side to side.
It was most disconcerting; the stone seemed bewitched.
He scrambled to his feet and walked
around it wondering how a mere rock could have
gotten itself into such a peculiar predicament.</p>

<p>Nothing but an ordinary stone; of that he soon
assured himself. It was so evenly balanced that
he might tip it over and send it crashing down the
cliffs if he chose. He was about to resume his former
seat behind it when he heard sounds in the valley
below. He poked his head over the cliff coping,
then as quickly withdrew it to avoid being
seen.</p>

<p>Two animals were plodding along the foot of the
cliffs. Soon they would pass directly beneath the
man crouching above their heads; also they would
pass beneath the Tilting Stone.</p>

<p>Gonch got upon his hands and knees growling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
softly like a tiger awaiting its prey. He had recognized
the two animals at a glance. They were
the Mammoth and Woolly Rhinoceros. This was
the chance of a lifetime. He a lone man might slay
one or both beasts by the mere touch of his hand.</p>

<p>“There are none here to see,” something within
him said. “Who will deny that the rock simply
fell? Who can say what caused it to fall? Be a
man and vent your spite on this mad flint-worker.”
He growled softly once more, set his shoulders
against the stone and waited.</p>

<p>The thumping of feet sounded almost beneath
the Tilting Stone. Gonch listened intently, timing
himself for the fateful moment. The beasts were
walking fast as he could hear but it was not given
him to know that the sounds took time travelling
from the foot of the cliffs to where he crouched.
The moment had arrived. He gave one mighty
shove. The stone lost its balance—almost too
slowly—then gathering momentum, went tumbling
over the cliff. For an instant, Gonch stood outlined
against the sky, then a shrill cry rang out
below and he jumped back just as the boulder
struck bottom with a tremendous crash. He heard
squeals and bellows but he dared not look to see,
for that voice—the cry of a human being, had terrified
him. Away he bolted across the plateau and
from the cliffs as fast as his legs would carry him.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Down in the valley, the boy Kutnar was running
toward the fallen boulder, shouting “Hi—yo!”
and waving his arms at the Mammoth and
Rhinoceros who were galloping away in a great
fright because of the falling stone that had crashed
to the ground so closely behind them. They heard
someone shouting and recognized Kutnar’s voice,
so they slowed up and looked back. All was now
quiet and finally by much arm-waving, the lad induced
his two friends to return. This they did
very slowly and carefully, not feeling entirely convinced
that all danger had passed. Kutnar was
perched astride of the great boulder that had so
nearly destroyed them. He spoke in the strange
tongue that Hairi and Wulli so well knew.</p>

<p>“I saw it falling,” he said as they came up. “I
shouted to warn you.”</p>

<p>The snorts, squeals and grunts with which the
two animals answered would have meant nothing
to an ordinary man; but Kutnar had no trouble
understanding them.</p>

<p>“A narrow escape,” sighed the Mammoth who
was trembling from head to foot. “It is but a
stone but it fell. What caused it to fall? It might
have killed us.”</p>

<p>“It would certainly have killed us, had it dropped
upon our backs,” said the Rhinoceros solemnly.
“Never was I so startled. I nearly jumped over
my nose-horn.”</p>

<p>“And I, over my tusks,” the Mammoth added.</p>

<p>Kutnar laughed. “Yes you both jumped like
rabbits”; then he looked up at the cliffs and his face
became serious. “The stone did not fall of itself,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
he said, half to himself. “Someone pushed it over.
I saw——”</p>

<p>“Someone pushed it?” inquired the Mammoth.
He looked thoughtfully at the great boulder and
shivered. It had been a nerve-racking experience.
He hoped he would never have another like it.</p>

<p>“Yes, someone pushed it,” Kutnar repeated.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. I saw him but an instant; then
he jumped back.”</p>

<p>“It must have been the Cave Lion,” the Mammoth
suggested. “He hates us and only a strong
animal could have moved such a big rock.”</p>

<p>“No, it was not the Cave Lion.” Kutnar became
silent as he watched the Rhinoceros who was now
sniffing the stone vigorously. Finally Wulli’s nose
settled on one spot and here he made a most thorough
investigation. When this was concluded to
his satisfaction, he raised his head and gazed triumphantly,
first at one then the other of his companions.</p>

<p>“I know,” he squealed. “I found where he
touched it. My nose never lies. I know.”</p>

<p>“Who was it?” the Mammoth asked.</p>

<p>“A hyena.”</p>

<p>“A hyena?” the boy laughed. “No, Wulli; you
are wrong for once. Smell again.”</p>

<p>The Rhinoceros took another long careful sniff.
Once more he raised his head and maintained stubbornly:
“My nose never lies, I tell you. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that smell of him who eats men and bad meat. I
say it was a hyena.”</p>

<p>For an instant the boy eyed his companion in
doubt. Heretofore Wulli’s nose had been infallible.
It was his eyes versus the Rhino’s nose.
Probably the eyes were mistaken. They had
caught only a fleeting glimpse. He laughed again.
A second laugh echoed overhead. The three
friends looked hastily upward and saw a hideous
face leering down upon them. Quick as lightning,
Kutnar made ready his sling and hurled a pebble.
A loud yelp and the face disappeared. “Hyena
it was,” said the lad. “Wulli is right; his nose
never lies, but had I not seen the beast a second
time, I would have sworn that he who pushed the
rock down upon us, was a man.”</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p>Gonch fled across the plateau until he
found a place where he could conceal himself
and here he stayed until he judged
that all danger of detection was past. Then
he made a wide detour and proceeded to the Rock
of Moustier, not from the valley side but across
the heights, a route rarely or never taken by ones
desiring to reach the grotto below.</p>

<p>As he halted at the cliff overlooking the cave-threshold,
he caught sight of a man squatting far
beneath him beside a fire. It was Pic engaged in
weapon-making. His right arm did not rise and
fall with each stroke of the hammerstone. He was
devoting his efforts to the finer work, retouching
flakes with the mysterious finishing tool. Gonch
lay flat upon his chest and stomach and peered over
the cliff. While so doing he was unconscious of
the fact that he had dislodged several stone chips
and caused them to fall.</p>

<p>Beneath him, the giant flint-worker still squatted
motionless beside the fire but his ears were straining,
his brain working rapidly as he sought the
meaning of dust and limestone chips mysteriously
descended upon him from above. The sun was
warm. It was quite a natural gesture for him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
turn his head askew and downward at the same
time and wipe the perspiration from it with his
arm; also it enabled him to catch a glimpse of a
man’s head peering down upon him from the cliff.</p>

<p>Pic resumed his former position but now he was
staring at his feet, his brows contracted in deep
thought. For several minutes he maintained this
attitude, then his brows lifted and he glanced at
what he held in his hand. It was a ridiculously
simple affair—a piece of bone not much larger than
his forefinger, smooth, straight and notched at one
end.</p>

<p>“Men have died for even less,” he soliloquized.
“I roamed the world over to find this piece of bone—the
Terrace Man’s finishing tool. Others may
be doing the same. Yes that’s it; I am sure of it
now,” and he scowled and gnashed his teeth in a
way that would have horrified Gonch, had he been
there to see.</p>

<p>For a time, Pic remained squatting motionless;
finally he rose to his feet, piled more wood upon the
fire and made other elaborate preparations as if
for departure, shouldering his ax and gazing long
and earnestly down the valley as though there were
something there that required his attention. He
gathered up his flint-flakes and took them to the
cave and last of all, secreted the bone tool near the
cliff wall beneath a flat stone. This latter maneuver
was conducted mysteriously and with much deliberation.
When all was arranged to his satisfaction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
he swung his ax over his right shoulder and
descended the causeway to the valley below.</p>

<p>The ledge was now deserted. Gonch could see
the master weapon maker sauntering leisurely
down the causeway. He had also seen his host
conceal something beneath a flat stone near the
foot of the cliffs. It must be something valuable
judging from the elaborate precautions taken to
hide it from view. It might be the flint-worker’s
finishing tool. If so, this was an opportunity not
to be missed.</p>

<p>The cliff-wall overlooking the ledge was too
steep and smooth for a speedy descent, so Gonch
sought the rougher and more sloping northeast side,
the one opposite that which Pic was descending.
This shut off his view of the latter and not until
he reached the level of the cave-ledge, could he
again obtain a glimpse of the causeway and anyone
who might be near the cave. He saw no one.
Pic had vanished and no doubt was making his way
down the valley along the base of the Rock.</p>

<p>Feeling assured on this point and convinced that
he was alone and safe from detection, Gonch crept
towards the flat stone lying at the foot of the cliff
wall, near the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>His hand was now clutching the stone. Another
second and the latter would have been raised disclosing
what lay beneath, when a rustling sounded
at the cave-mouth. Gonch turned quickly, then
sank down upon the threshold in an agony of dread,
for there stood Pic, filling the cave-mouth with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
great bulk and gazing down upon the Muskman
with a look of withering scorn.</p>

<p>“I lost something, I—” stammered Gonch but
the other cut him short.</p>

<p>“You lie,” roared Pic, his face becoming rapidly
convulsed with rage. “You lie and have lied ever
since you came here. I know you now and why
you came. To the muck with you and your filthy
smell. Your whole body reeks with carrion.
Your welcome is at an end, imposter. Begone.”</p>

<p>“But—you mistake,” protested the Muskman,
summoning fresh courage on finding his life in no
immediate danger. Pic’s ire only increased. His
face became that of a demon.</p>

<p>“You are alive now,” he thundered. “Soon you
Will not be. Go at once. If you are found in the
valley after the next sunrise, your friends the
hyenas will be cracking your bones”; and Pic spat
upon the cringing Muskman as he would have spat
upon a snake.</p>

<p>Gonch crawled away along the ledge and down
the causeway like a beaten hound, terrified but
thankful enough that the giant’s teeth and hands
were not now tearing his throat. The farther he
got away, however, the more comfortable he felt
in body and mind, and by the time he reached the
valley his courage had in a great measure returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>He was safe—for the present—and having no
immediate concern on that point, he began to consider
and reflect bitterly upon the sudden miscarriage
of his plans. Now he could no more think of
persuading the master flint-worker to return with
him than he could of compelling him to do so by
force. The very thought of using force on Pic
made him squirm. He might more easily overcome
a lion.</p>

<p>As he walked down the valley, his thoughts
turned to Totan and the men of Castillo. What
would they say when he returned discredited and
empty-handed? The big hetman was not one who
dealt gently with vain boasters. Gonch could
almost feel the hetman’s club crashing down upon
his pate. Pic here, Totan there; whether he stayed
or went, it was all the same—a giant waiting to
crush the life out of him. Gonch felt himself between
the devil and the deep, blue sea.</p>

<p>Pic was a friend of animals and a lover of peace,
but the prosperity and power that he had brought
upon the cave-men of the Vézère was not to be
denied. They were the strongest men, the most
successful hunters in all the world, and all because
of Pic, the genius that ruled over them. No one
had said that the master flint-worker was hetman
of the Mousterians, but Gonch knew it now, and
he knew it without being told. He had failed miserably.
Pic the Lion had snared Gonch the Fox
with scarce an effort. To all appearances the former
was but a flint-worker, skilled beyond belief
and a physical giant to boot, but with the disposition
of a child, peacefully inclined towards man
and beast. A fool? hardly; even though Gonch
hated him for not being one. His arm ruled over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the Vézère like the paw of a gigantic lion, its claws
drawn into their sheath-pads, its powerful muscles
hidden beneath their covering of heavy fur.</p>

<p>It was all just as had first been told to him in
the southland. Gonch bit his lips until the blood
came. Now he saw the truth of what he did not
then believe from the lips of the man he himself
had slain near the northern Cantabrian slopes. The
Mousterian domain was the most powerful in all
the world, and the arm that ruled over it, the mind
that guided its destinies, were those of a simple
flint-worker and weapon maker—Pic, the Mammoth
Man.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p>With Pic’s warning and fear of the giant
weapon maker to spur him on, Gonch
made haste to escape from the Mousterian
country. He was hurrying to
the southwest along the right bank of the Vézère
River when suddenly a shrill scream sounded in
the distance ahead of him. It was the cry of some
animal in distress. A second and third cry rang
out, closely following the first; then came piercing
trumpet calls and loud bellows. Gonch sank upon
his hands and knees and crawled through the grass
in the direction of the cries. Soon he came upon
him who made them and learned their cause. The
Mammoth was bogged in a slough.</p>

<p>The huge beast had unwittingly trod upon the
soft ground and was caught fast. This was one
enemy that sapped his courage of its last drop, and
now it held him in its death-grip. Maddened by his
vain struggles, he had worked himself into a frenzy
of terror; squealing, bellowing and thrashing his
trunk about like a great flail.</p>

<p>The Muskman grinned with fiendish pleasure.
He advanced to the quagmire and squatted comfortably
at its edge. He felt perfectly safe and
was only anxious lest he might miss any portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of the grand and glorious scene. It was a small
slough, and the terrified Mammoth stood so near
firm ground that only a few steps were needed to
bring him safely clear. He seemed to realize this,
for he strained and tugged mightily to escape the
mire that sucked him down, directing his efforts
toward the pit-edge nearest him. One after another
he pulled his feet from the slime, but only
one at a time, and as fast as one was free the others
sank deeper. The more he struggled, the more
securely was he trapped. This was the way with
all mired animals. Cave-men often used these
made-to-order traps as aids in the capture of large
game. Gonch had seen many a horse, bison or ox
in a similar predicament, but never had it been his
good fortune to come upon an elephant so caught.</p>

<p>“Pic’s friend; so much the better,” he sneered.
At the sound of his voice the Mammoth became
quiet. In his terror he had not before perceived
the man squatting beside him. He squealed plaintively
as much as to say: “Friends should ever
help each other,” and stood waiting, trembling and
expectant. Gonch never moved, but grinned fiendishly
at the great beast begging for assistance.
He gathered a handful of dirt and threw it in the
Mammoth’s face.</p>

<p>The latter recoiled in surprise, then his ears
flapped wildly and he bellowed loudly with rage.
This change of sentiment helped him as nothing
else could. He heaved and pulled, using his trunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
as a lever on the pit-edge, forgetting all fear in
his eagerness to reach and chastise the man.</p>

<p>Gonch arose and retreated several steps to where
several detached limestone blocks lay embedded in
the soil. He secured one, the biggest he could lift,
and returned to the Mammoth.</p>

<p>The latter must have known what was in store
for him, for as Gonch hurled the stone at the base
of his trunk the Mammoth suddenly ducked and
received the blow upon his head-peak, a bony prominence
reinforced within by air-cells and protected
from without by a thick mop of shaggy hair. A
painful bruise, but no real damage done. Gonch
procured another stone and made ready to try
again.</p>

<p>And then something swept down upon him with
the weight and fury of an avalanche and sent him
sprawling in the grass. As he lay helpless, wondering
what had happened, he saw a rotund, short-legged
animal bringing itself up short upon its
haunches. Gonch trembled as the beast turned as
though to make a second charge. However, to his
great relief, the Rhinoceros paid no further attention
to him, but devoted himself entirely to the
Mammoth, walking along the margin of the morass
and studying the situation his friend was in, with
the utmost deliberation.</p>

<p>Gonch crawled away to hide himself behind a
stone and watch.</p>

<p>It took the Woolly Rhinoceros several minutes
to realize his friend’s plight and to devise ways and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
means for effecting a rescue. Having determined
his course, he anchored his forefeet firmly and as
close to the pit as he dared, then extended his head
toward the Mammoth. The latter responded by
raising his trunk and curling its flexible tip about
the other’s nose-horn, a formidable affair about
two feet long, as smooth and glossy as polished
steel. When assured that his partner had secured
a firm grip, the Woolly Rhinoceros settled back his
full weight, at the same time pushing hard with his
legs.</p>

<p>The Mammoth’s trunk tautened until it seemed
about to break. His feet drew clear of the mire
one by one, slowly but surely; and now that the
Rhinoceros was relieving him of so much of his
dead weight, he clung to that nose-horn with the
persistence of one drowning. Even when his right
forefoot touched solid ground, he did not release
this hold. “Friends should ever help each other”
might not be considered a slogan applicable to
beasts, but Gonch saw it being applied now and in
most marvelous fashion.</p>

<p>“I am asleep,” he thought. “What I now see is
but a dream.” The Mammoth had by this time
freed his front limbs and was resting with his feet
and elbows on the pit-edge. Meanwhile the Rhinoceros
maintained the tension on his partner’s
trunk, hanging on as determinedly as a bull-dog.
Having rested, the Mammoth now concentrated
every ounce of his strength for the final heave.
The Rhinoceros, too, put on more power until his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
friend’s nose-spout stretched almost to the breaking
point.</p>

<p>The Mammoth’s hindquarters slowly emerged
from the engulfing slime. The soft ooze slobbered
and sighed as the rear pillar limbs drew clear, and
the next moment both beasts stood shoulder to
shoulder, stamping and snorting with rage.</p>

<p>They sniffed vigorously, but the wind told no
tales, for it blew from them—the wrong way.
Lucky Gonch! The time had not yet come for him
to be impaled upon the horn of a rhinoceros or
crushed beneath an elephant’s ponderous feet. The
breeze was his friend and the eyesight of his enemies
was comparatively poor. He made himself as
small as possible and lay motionless behind the
stone, entirely unconscious that the grunts and
squeals he heard were animal conversation.</p>

<p>“He must have gone away,” said Wulli. “I can
neither see nor smell him.”</p>

<p>“To smell him is to know him,” the Mammoth
grumbled. “Never have I known a man to bear
such an odor.”</p>

<p>“It is that of a hyena,” said the Rhinoceros.</p>

<p>“Let us find and punish him.” The huge Elephant
ground his teeth as he said this. Although
slow to anger, he could neither forgive nor forget.</p>

<p>Gonch peered cautiously over the stone. The
two beasts were walking away side by side.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“A happy ending to an unpleasant dream,” he
thought as he watched the pair disappearing behind
rocks and trees. He raised himself into a crouching
position just as a big-eared head arose with him
from the grass, about ten paces distant. It was a
maneless head with repulsive features and slopping
jaws. It grinned horribly at the man, and yet
made no move to attack him. “One would think the
beast my friend,” thought Gonch as he stood erect
with ax held ready to defend himself.</p>

<p>“A hyena, but never have I seen such a big one.
The Mammoth has cheated us both,” he said aloud
to the beast. “We must wait and hope for the
chance that may come again.”</p>

<p>The Hyena licked his muzzle and leered at the
man, then turned and walked slowly away. A sloping
back and bushy tail trailed behind the huge
head. Such trust in human nature was astounding.
The Muskman might have glided stealthily after
and slain the brute before it could turn and defend
itself. He was standing motionless, watching the
gray back melt away in the meadow grass, when he
heard sounds in the opposite direction. The bushes
waved and crackled, and he made out a human form
coming through them and rapidly toward him.</p>

<p>Gonch dropped flat in the grass and lay still.
The crackling sounds and he who made them came
nearer. The Muskman could now see his face.
He breathed a deep sigh of relief. In a moment
he was on his feet and advancing to meet the newcomer.
It was the boy Kutnar.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p>At sight of the approaching Muskman, Kutnar
shouted a glad “Hi-yo!” and ran forward
to meet him.</p>

<p>“You are too young to be traveling
about alone,” said Gonch when the pair came together.</p>

<p>The boy pouted. “Do not worry. I can take
care of myself.” He now bore an ax in addition
to the sling and stone-pouch which he always carried.
“I have not been alone long,” he added.
“Wulli was with me. He strayed off somewhere,
and I was just looking for him.”</p>

<p>“Wulli?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Woolly Rhinoceros. That is the name
we know him by. The Mammoth is Hairi.”</p>

<p>“They both passed me some time ago,” said the
Muskman. “They were strolling side by side up
the valley.” For obvious reasons he made no mention
of the slough and what had occurred there.
The part he had played had best be known to
nobody but himself.</p>

<p>“Good,” said the boy, much relieved. “I heard
squeals and thought that one of them might be in
trouble.”</p>

<p>“No trouble at all,” Gonch assured him. “They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
seemed quite happy and contented as they went
away together. Strange why they should choose
each other for companions. Are the two such good
friends?”</p>

<p>“The best of friends,” Kutnar replied. “They
would fight and die for each other. Any man or
beast who attacks one of them has to fight both.
It was the Mammoth who first said, ‘Friends should
ever help each other.’ He says it and does it, too;
so does the Rhinoceros.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” Gonch began to feel hot and uncomfortable.
It had suddenly occurred to him that
Pic would soon learn from his friend the Mammoth
of what had happened in the slough. He would
not forget to tell of the man who had attacked him
when he was unable to defend himself. Soon the
whole valley would be in an uproar. Gonch shuddered
as he thought of what Pic would do to him,
if ever he was caught.</p>

<p>“Your father is much interested in the Hairy
Elephant,” said Gonch. “I understand that he
permits no one to hunt him. Would the latter go
to him if any man were bold enough to harm the
beast?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps; perhaps not,” replied the youth. “He
and Wulli are sometimes queer about such matters.
Like as not they would keep quiet and punish the
offender themselves. Wulli in particular is inclined
that way. However, you never can tell. Only this
morning a rock, the Tilting Stone, fell from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
cliff and barely missed destroying both animals. I
doubt if my father yet knows of this.”</p>

<p>“And there would be only the rock to punish if
he did know of it,” said Gonch.</p>

<p>“Also him who pushed it down,” the boy added.</p>

<p>“How?” the Muskman was in a cold sweat.
“Who pushed it down?”</p>

<p>“A hyena,” the lad replied. “At first I thought
it was a man.”</p>

<p>Gonch gasped and wiped his forehead. “No,
your father does not know of this. I was with him
on the Rock only a short time ago, and he made
no mention of it. Your father and I have grown
to be very fond of one another. Only this morning
he was showing me how he made his flints.”</p>

<p>“How he finished them?” asked the lad in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, with the little tool. Do you know how it
is done?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I do,” was the answer. “My father
says that I am to become a weapon maker, and so
he has taught me how to do the work. Some day I
will do as well as he, so he says.”</p>

<p>“Um-m!” The Muskman’s eyes sparkled with
a strange light. He had failed miserably and was
a fugitive from Pic’s wrath, but now—the possibilities
were unlimited. He might escape and
succeed both.</p>

<p>“Wonderful boy,” he muttered. “And so you
can make the fine blades with the little finishing
tool. How surprising. And now I am about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
tell you something. If you were not as good a
friend of mine as I am yours, I could not bring
myself to say it.”</p>

<p>“Agh, but I am your good friend,” Kutnar
answered quickly. “You should tell me everything.”</p>

<p>“And you will not repeat what I say?” Gonch
asked. “Your father and I must be very careful.
Some one might hear of it.”</p>

<p>“Hear of what?” the boy inquired, now beside
himself with curiosity. “I will be silent. Tell me.”</p>

<p>Gonch glanced about him. “Sh!” he said, lowering
his voice and assuming an air of deep mystery.
“We southrons have a new and better way of finishing
the flints.”</p>

<p>“A better way?” the boy stared. “Impossible.”</p>

<p>“No, it is true,” Gonch declared impressively.
“Your father agrees with me that our method is
the best. I am to get it and bring it to him.”</p>

<p>“Get what?”</p>

<p>“The new finishing tool; cannot you understand?”
the Muskman grumbled. “You see, I am
grateful because you and your father have been
very good to me. I am to live the rest of my life
here, helping with the weapon-making. And now
I must hurry away to get the finishing tool—the
wonderful tool that we make our fine blades with.
I will be so lonely, going away without you. That
will hasten my return.” He embraced the boy and
lingered over him. His whole manner was charged
with a pathos that astonished even himself; but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
affairs were nearing a crisis and the present occasion
called for the best he had in him. Then as
he hesitated with his heart-breaking farewell, hoping
and praying for the fulfillment of his wishes,
his heart suddenly sank. Kutnar’s nostrils had
caught the offensive beast odor. He detached himself
from the other’s arms and turned away his
head.</p>

<p>“Is my best friend offended by the smell of my
panther and hyena killing?” Gonch asked in a hurt
voice. “Perhaps I did but a poor service when
once I saved you from death.”</p>

<p>On being thus reminded of his debt, Kutnar
experienced a wave of remorse. He clung tightly
to his friend and buried his face in his chest. “Agh,
you did well,” he whispered earnestly. “What
you have done for me makes the odor sweet. I
will not have you leave me alone. We will go
together.”</p>

<p>“Would that it were possible. I would be so
happy with you as my companion. But, you see,
I must hurry. I cannot wait while you prepare
yourself for the journey.”</p>

<p>The boy looked scornfully at the Muskman’s
equipment, which consisted of nothing but an ax.
“I am as much prepared as you are,” he said. “We
can both go at once.”</p>

<p>Gonch yielded with seeming reluctance, and so
they hurried off together, Gonch chatting and
pointing out various things of interest, to divert
the lad’s mind and prevent its turning too strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to home and friends. However, Kutnar needed no
encouragement. This was his first long trip away
from home, but the thought of new adventures and
things to see filled him with delight and anticipation.
Deep down within his heart was a subdued
feeling that he was playing the part of truant and
that his father and friends might not like his sudden
leave-taking. But he had a good friend with
him, and his father would soon understand that the
two of them had gone away together, also why and
where they had gone. He wished that he might
at least say good-by to the Mammoth and Rhinoceros;
but there was no time to do this or to see
any one, so he put these matters out of his mind
and went his way.</p>

<p>The two traveled the balance of that day and far
into the night, for Gonch confided that he was
anxious to reach his destination and return before
the cold weather set in. After a short rest, they
were up with the sun and away again.</p>

<p>Gonch was really anxious to get a good, long
start; also he feared that already he was being pursued.
He had observed two animals—a large and
a smaller one—trailing far in his rear and suspected
them to be the Mammoth and Rhinoceros.</p>

<p>To throw them off the track, when he and Kutnar
came to a river, instead of swimming directly
across, they waded down stream for some distance,
then landed and resumed the original direction of
their journey.</p>

<p>If the Mammoth and Rhinoceros were really following,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
this ruse must have succeeded; for although
Gonch kept a sharp eye on his line of retreat, he
saw no more sign of pursuers. All fear of Pic and
his friends now vanished, and his thoughts turned
to the southland and the Cavern of Castillo.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<h2>X</h2>

<p>The next morning found Pic squatting beside
his fire before the grotto of Moustier.
He was engaged in his usual occupation—weapon-making.
It had been over twenty-four
hours since he last saw Kutnar, but this gave
him no particular cause for worry. The boy went
to and fro, spending as much of his time in the valley
as he did upon the Rock. He had been known
to have absented himself from home several days
at a time. “I was even more restless than he at
his age,” chuckled Pic. “Probably he is off on some
lark,” and so he went on with his flint-working.
His entire day was spent alone and the night, too.
Nothing to worry about seriously, but when morning
came and the boy was still absent, Pic began
to feel not altogether at his ease.</p>

<p>He endeavored to resume his work, but, finding
that he was striking the flint-flakes everywhere but
the right place, he put aside his hammerstone and
armed with a flint-ax, descended into the valley.</p>

<p>Here he was met by a party of Mousterian
hunters. All welcomed him and showed no small
surprise, for rarely did he take part in their activities
unless something unusual was afoot. To his
question, “The boy Kutnar; where is he?” none
could give a satisfactory reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“He may have gone somewhere with the Mammoth
and Rhinoceros,” one of the hunters suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes, the three of them must be together,” Pic
agreed. “The boy is perfectly safe in the company
of two such powerful animals,” and, feeling much
comforted, he returned to the Rock and resumed
his work. And yet, although inwardly rebuking
himself for his needless concern, many times that
day he put aside his hammerstone and gazed up and
down the valley. When night came he retired later
than was his custom, and his rest was broken by
many wakeful moments, at which times he would
arise and seek the cave-threshold, hoping that the
boy had returned. Vain hope, for when morning
broke, Kutnar was still absent.</p>

<p>Pic strode to and fro upon the ledge, turning
his head this way and that like a caged lion. From
his elevated position he could see up and down the
valley for many miles. The Mammoth, at least,
could be seen if he were anywhere near; but, strain
his eyes as he would, Pic caught not a single
glimpse of the huge and familiar figure. He did
no work that morning, for his anxiety had greatly
increased, and he made no further effort to conceal
it. “I fear that something is wrong,” he said.
“Otherwise Kutnar would have returned long before
this.”</p>

<p>Once more he descended to the valley and sought
news from his men, but there was none to be had,
and his worry thereby increased. The cave-men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
were beginning to gather about by twos and threes,
for word had already passed that their chieftain
was greatly concerned because of his son’s continued
absence. Soon a crowd of them had assembled,
but not one man had any information worth
giving.</p>

<p>“He might be with the stranger,” suggested itself
to Pic. “The two have been much together.” This
thought both angered and alarmed him. He
scowled as he asked, “Has any one seen Gonch?”</p>

<p>Nobody had seen him for several days. When
last observed he was alone and on his way somewhere
down the valley.</p>

<p>“The bird has flown,” thought Pic much relieved.
“For a moment I thought—but no, the skulker
would not have dared. He values his life too
highly;” but even though his fears as to Gonch were
quieted, he felt it time to set the machinery in
motion for a systematic search.</p>

<p>The cave-men were divided into squads, which
scattered in all directions, up, down and across the
valley, examining every nook and corner as they
went. Pic at the head of one of the squads hurried
southwestward along the river bank. Before
dividing his men, he said: “The man Gonch is a
traitor. If you come upon him, kill him,” whereat
all stared in surprise, but hastened to do as bidden
without asking questions.</p>

<p>Pic and his band hurried downstream along the
right bank of the Vézère. The giant flint-worker
led the way, running in and out among the rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and bushes like a hound following a trail. He held
his ax in readiness to strike down man or beast
as he led the way fearlessly past ledge and thicket,
from which hidden enemies might have sprung
upon him. His voice thundered commands, and
all hastened to obey. The cave-men were amazed
by his fierce energy. He was a being transformed;
this strange man, of whom it had been said that he
would neither hunt nor fight. They reached the
confluence of the Vézère and Dordogne rivers.
Suddenly Pic uttered a loud shout as two shaggy
heads rose above the river bank. The Mammoth
and Rhinoceros were emerging from the water after
a swim from the opposite bank. They presented a
woe-begone and exhausted appearance, as though
their entire night had been spent in traveling without
food and rest.</p>

<p>As Pic ran forward to meet them, his followers
halted at a respectful distance. The two animals
shook the river water out of their coats and then
told their story.</p>

<p>The Hyena Man, meaning Gonch, had fled, taking
Kutnar with him. He had a peculiar and unpleasant
odor, which was fortunate, for it had
enabled them to follow his trail without much trouble.
His scent was so strong that they could not
understand how they had lost it, but anyhow, after
crossing a river, they had been unable to find it
again. A mean trick had been played upon them,
they were positive, but, not knowing just what to
do next, they had returned for assistance. Both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
were agreed that the Hyena Man could no longer
be trusted. He had tried to kill the Mammoth
when the latter was caught fast in the mud. The
big elephant had a bump on his forehead to show
for it. He felt much aggrieved at such treatment
and intended to trample the Hyena Man to death
if ever he caught him, but the wretch had escaped,
and, to make matters worse, he had taken Kutnar
along with him.</p>

<p>That was all, but quite enough. Pic was furious.
He raged like a mad bull. The cave-men
crowded about him, shouting and brandishing their
weapons. But raging and shouting led to nothing;
Pic soon realized that much. Gonch had several
days’ start; also he knew just where he was going,
which the others did not. He had anticipated pursuit
by performing the well-known water trick,
thereby throwing the Mammoth and Rhinoceros off
his track. Pic became deadly calm. His men were
of no use to him now. He could kill Gonch without
any one’s assistance, but the trouble was to
catch him. Speed was what he desired most.
Without it, he could never hope to overtake his
enemy. Every moment of delay now counted
against him. He raised his hands in despair to the
Mammoth. “Friends should ever help each other,”
he groaned in beast jargon. “Would that I were a
bird to fly or a deer to speed over the meadows like
the rushing wind. How can I hope to overtake the
traitor and save my boy?”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>As if in reply, the Mammoth raised his foreleg
and stood at attention. Pic’s despair changed to
amazement, then understanding. Like a flash, he
sprang upon the beast’s uplifted limb and seized
his ear. A moment later and he was up and astride
the great shaggy neck, sitting comfortably in the
depression between head and shoulder. The cave-men
waved their axes and shouted themselves
hoarse: “Kill, kill! Death to the traitor!” and
then Pic raised his hand. All became quiet, listening
to their leader’s final instructions.</p>

<p>“You,” he said, pointing to a young giant seamed
with battle-scars; “you must command here, and
death to him who disobeys you. I may be gone
many days. He who makes trouble in my absence
will be food for the hyenas when I return. Good-luck
to you and farewell. I will not come back
without the boy.”</p>

<p>“Long live the Mammoth Man; death to
Gonch,” howled the cave-men, waving their axes
on high. Obedient to a hand-pat from his rider,
the Mammoth wheeled and made for the river. Pic
heard footsteps behind him. He looked back and
frowned as he saw the Woolly Rhinoceros following
closely on his partner’s heels.</p>

<p>“Not this time, good old friend,” he said. “You
are too slow and will only delay us. You must stay
behind.”</p>

<p>Wulli stopped short. The words rang in his
ears like the sound of his own doom; but Pic had
said them. He stopped obediently and stood, head
cocked on one side, a prey to his ponderous reflections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
The Mammoth had by this time entered the
water, and still the Rhinoceros remained immovable
watching the unsubmerged portion of his
friend sailing rapidly across the stream.</p>

<p>So intent was he, so intent were the cave-men
upon Pic and the Mammoth’s departure, that none
perceived a spectre in the background slinking
leisurely away. It was a big-eared beast with
ghoul-grinning face and slopping jaws. It had
been an interested witness of all that had passed,
but none had seen or heard the foul beast of ill-omen,
Crocut the Bone-breaker and giant leader
of the Cave Hyenas.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<p>Grun Waugh the Cave Lion reclined
comfortably upon his side, beneath the
lofty rock-shelter of Mawdlin—an overhanging
cliff close to the right bank of
the Vézère River. A few paces distant sat Scrag,
his half-grown son. The latter was in the midst
of his morning paw-scrub, a self-inflicted process
indulged in by all members of the cat family and
vulgarly known as “spit-wash.”</p>

<p>Scrag had spent the night in some wild orgy
and had but recently returned home in the gray
morning hours to where his parent awaited him.
Judging from his appearance, he had experienced
a lively time of it. His right eye was bunged and
gashed so that he was obliged to depend entirely
upon his left. One ear was torn and bleeding; it
seemed to have been chewed. Father and son were
conversing in low growls. At the moment Scrag
had the floor and was recounting the details of his
night’s adventures.</p>

<p>“I was hiding in the grass; lying low, chest and
stomach to the ground, just as you have always told
me to do. I cannot account for it, but he must
have seen me.”</p>

<p>“How about your tail?” his sire remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
gruffly. “No doubt, that was waving in the air so
that even a mole could see it.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” Scrag admitted, slightly elevating
the brows crowning his one good eye. “I may have
been a trifle careless as to tail. I never thought
about it. Well, anyhow, just as he passed me, I
jumped.”</p>

<p>“And missed, I presume,” the Cave Lion grumbled
with an I-suppose-I’ll-have-to-pay-the-bill air.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” chuckled the other, applying himself
diligently to his toilet. “True, I missed what
I jumped at”—souse, souse—“but I did”—swish,
swish—“hit something.”</p>

<p>“What?” Grun Waugh snorted impatiently.</p>

<p>“A rock,” snickered Scrag, all set and ready to
run. “I struck it head-on and bumped my eye.
For an instant I was half-stunned; but luckily for
me I had senses enough left to remember something
else you used to tell me.”</p>

<p>“What?” roared Grun Waugh.</p>

<p>“That I had four good legs and knew how to use
them. Did I use them? I most certainly did. You
would have been proud of your little Scraggy had
you been there to see.”</p>

<p>“Whelp!” thundered the Cave Lion. “Never
will I hear the last of this. You, son of the grandest
and boldest among flesh-eaters, fled from——”</p>

<p>“The Woolly Rhinoceros,” leered Scrag, screwing
up his face. He stroked his chin bristles with
his forepaw and looked thoughtfully at Grun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Waugh as he added mischievously: “Now, who
was it taught me to do that?”</p>

<p>The Cave Lion said nothing, but he was choking
with suppressed rage, and his tail squirmed like
a snake on a hot griddle. There were but two animals
in the world that he had been known to run
from, and the Woolly Rhinoceros was one of them.</p>

<p>He was brooding angrily over the matter and
endeavoring to formulate some plausible excuse,
when a burly figure suddenly thrust itself between
him and the light. He looked up quickly and saw
standing before him Crocut, his henchman and
giant leader of the Hyena Pack.</p>

<p>Crocut settled down upon his haunches and
grinned, first at Grun Waugh, then at Scrag. He
always grinned and meant nothing in particular by
it, for his face was simply built that way. It may
be that, as head undertaker of the Vézère valley, it
was his place to appear cheerful at all times, and
because of that he either grinned or laughed. His
grin was a death-mask and his laugh a voice from
the grave.</p>

<p>Grun Waugh and Crocut had formed a partnership
and were engaged in the meat business—wholesale
and retail. Crocut selected the live-stock and
Grun Waugh did the killing or dangerous work.
He received the freshest and choicest cuts as his
share, after which Crocut cleared away the remains
and disposed of the by-products. The giant Hyena
employed members of his own family as scavengers
for this latter purpose. It was also one of his important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
duties to develop new business, and so he
wandered about continually, searching for occasional
horse, ox, bison or other animal that might
have strayed from its herd and could be attacked
to advantage. It then remained for him to convey
such information to his royal master the Cave Lion.
Crocut had scruples and conscientiously refrained
from intruding upon the executive or killing end
of the business. This was Grun Waugh’s prerogative.
The two got along finely by thus working in
perfect harmony.</p>

<p>The leader of the Hyena Pack brought news,
otherwise he would not have come. “I have much
to tell you,” he began. “First, I will speak of the
Woolly Rhinoceros.”</p>

<p>Grun Waugh scowled and wrinkled his muzzle.
Again that name; but, although at first greatly
vexed, he listened attentively as Crocut told of a
man who had pushed a big rock over the cliff. This
rock had barely missed crushing the Rhinoceros,
also the Mammoth, who was with him. Crocut had
seen this with his own eyes.</p>

<p>“Escaped; always escaped,” growled the Cave
Lion. “Had either the Rhinoceros or Mammoth
been killed, it would have been different; but as it
is, the tale annoys me.”</p>

<p>“I, too, have suffered in order that my lord might
learn all,” whined the Hyena. “The Trog-boy was
with the two animals. He threw a stone at me and
bruised my jaw. It is so sore that for several days
I have been unable to crack even the smallest bone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Crocut grit his teeth, then winced with the pain
which even this slight pressure caused him; then
discovering that he was arousing no sympathy, he
resumed: “Irritating, indeed; but please remember
that it was a man who so nearly slew the Mammoth
and Rhinoceros. Heretofore, none of the
Trog-folk have dared attack the two animals.”</p>

<p>“Hagh!” Grun Waugh pricked up his ears.
The tale now presented features of interest. “Not
bad,” he said to Scrag, but the latter was already
past hearing. He had curled himself up into a ball
and was sound asleep.</p>

<p>“I have taken much interest in this man,” Crocut
went on. “He has the odor of a hyena, and yet he
appears to be a man. Possibly he is a relative;
surely a friend. In addition to the first episode,
he a second time attacked the Mammoth.”</p>

<p>Grun Waugh was now sitting up, his features
expressing rapt attention. The moment of silence
was broken by only Scrag’s resonant snores. Crocut
described the scene at the slough and the Mammoth’s
narrow escape. It was exasperating to
think that the huge elephant had gotten off scot-free,
and yet the narrative had its brighter side—the
man’s share in it. He had done his part well,
and the failure was no fault of his. Grun Waugh
was beginning to feel kindly toward this Hyena
Man. He purred softly and stretched his claws.
Scrag snored peacefully on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have not yet told all,” the giant bone-breaker
resumed. “The Hyena Man—our friend, if I may
be so bold to say it—is now doing even better.
Already he has set upon the Ape Man.”</p>

<p>Grun Waugh licked his flewed lips as though
anticipating a feast. His purring became a gargle.
He gave an attentive ear to the balance of Crocut’s
thrilling account to the accompaniment of Scrag’s
nose-racking snores. The Ape Man meant Pic.
All flesh-eaters called him that and hated him most
cordially into the bargain. Grun Waugh hated
him worst of all, for it was whispered among beasts
that this Ape Man, when a boy, had dethroned
their royal monarch, the Lion. None dared speak
such words aloud, but it was no secret that the puny
Trog-boy had once driven Grun Waugh from the
Grotto of Moustier and, having taken possession,
had successfully resisted repeated attempts to dislodge
him. It was only fair to explain that this
same Trog-boy had not acted in an entirely honorable
manner. He had employed fire as his chief
means of defense, and, of course, fire was a thing
that no beast, however brave and strong, could
contend with.</p>

<p>Crocut explained that the stranger had not
attacked the Ape Man directly, but it would seem
that he had done even better. He had robbed him
of his whelp and was now fleeing southward. The
whole valley was in an uproar over the matter.
Already the Ape Man had hurried off in pursuit,
riding upon his friend the Mammoth. If they
caught the Hyena Man, it would go hard with him.
It was unfortunate and Crocut wished that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
fugitive might in some way elude his pursuers, but
the Mammoth was swift of foot, and there was no
telling what might happen.</p>

<p>Grun Waugh leaped to his feet and gave vent
to a thunderous roar. “And so the Mammoth and
Ape Man are pursuing the Hyena Man,” he said
fiercely. “Meddlers! We will follow and chastise
them for interfering.”</p>

<p>Crocut wilted. He hung his head and looked
about him as though seeking an avenue of escape.
It began to look as though there might be some
fighting, and, of course, he wanted to keep clear of
that. “In your absence, I——” he began, and
then held his peace, for Grun Waugh’s cold green
eyes were directed full upon him.</p>

<p>“You will go with us, of course,” said the Cave
Lion, biting his moustache and thereby displaying
his huge canine teeth. “You began this, and now
you must see it through. Come, Scrag.”</p>

<p>The prodigal son yawned and stretched his limbs;
then with a wry face stood erect and wiped the sleep
from his one good eye. Crocut groaned inwardly.
Although a bone-breaker of the first order, he
aimed at all times to be numbered among the spectators
whenever there was fighting to be done.
However, the Cave Lion had spoken, and there
seemed no way out of it. And so, under his guidance,
the three hurried down the river bank to the
Dordogne, where they picked up the Mammoth’s
trail and followed it across the stream to the southland
beyond.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<p>Gonch was in high fettle. He no longer
feared pursuit and figured that already the
race was as good as won. His enthusiasm
was contagious. Kutnar caught it, and
what with his thought of journeying to an unknown
land, he was thrilled to his very soul. He was having
a wonderful time; so many adventures and new
things to see and all because of his good friend
Gonch.</p>

<p>The two runaways swam across a stream south
of the Dordogne River and found the water so icy
that when they reached the opposite side at first
they could not climb the bank. They danced and
thrashed their arms about to restore the blood circulation
in their numbed bodies and were finally
able to move on. As for Gonch, now that he had
no real troubles to worry him, he was having a very
enjoyable trip homeward. The boy was an excellent
companion. Never had Gonch so enjoyed
himself.</p>

<p>Then came the fly in his ointment. The two
were making their way across the lowlands to the
Midouze River. The Muskman occasionally
glanced behind, more from force of habit than as a
measure of precaution, but finally he saw something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
on the distant horizon that made his heart jump
almost into his mouth. It appeared no larger than
a speck, but it was a living thing, for Gonch saw
it move and knew it to be a large animal by comparison
with the rocks and trees about it. Only
one beast was of such size.</p>

<p>Gonch had a most uncomfortable feeling that
the Mammoth was pursuing him because of that
unfortunate episode by the slough. He would have
given much to erase that mad scrape and still possess
the great beast’s good will. But it was too
late for wishing things that were not. The Mammoth,
once foiled, had set himself right somehow
and was not far behind.</p>

<p>He and Kutnar were nearing a grove which bordered
the Midouze. The approaching cold season
had entirely defoliated it, but the closely growing
timber and underwood offered chance of concealment.
Before plunging into the tangled mass of
tree-trunks, brush and vines, Gonch took another
look behind him. The distant speck had grown
much larger. It presented a full-length view.
Gonch could have sworn that it carried something
upon its back.</p>

<p>“Does the Mammoth ever wander about alone?”
he asked of the boy.</p>

<p>“Never that I know of,” was the answer. “Wulli
is always with him.”</p>

<p>“On the Mammoth’s back?” Gonch pretended
to be joking.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” Kutnar laughed. “None but my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
father ever sat astride him. Hairi would never
permit any other to do such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Your father? Ugh.” Gonch felt the humor
all knocked out of him.</p>

<p>“Yes, he rides the Mammoth when he wishes to
go far and fast. Hairi appears slow and clumsy,
but none but a swift-footed animal can keep up
with him. Why? What made you think of him?”</p>

<p>“Um, nothing,” replied Gonch, quickening his
pace. His fun was now thoroughly spoiled.</p>

<p>He now understood why the big elephant had
been able to pick up the trail once more. A man
had helped him—a man familiar with human trickery.
Gonch’s position was rapidly becoming a desperate
one. The Mammoth’s speed, combined with
his rider’s intelligence, would soon bring the chase
to an end.</p>

<p>Gonch and Kutnar hurried through the woods
and arrived at the river bank. The former waded
into the water with the latter close behind him.
The lad was preparing to swim across when Gonch
whispered, “Not that way,” and waded upstream as
fast as he could. The two had progressed fifty
yards or more when Gonch stopped at the sound of
a violent commotion among the trees. His pursuers
were almost upon him. Beckoning Kutnar to
follow, he waded back to the bank, climbed up and
dashed into the woods. Again sounded the snapping
of branches and brush trodden under foot.
Man and boy dropped flat to earth and lay still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;" id="illus10">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Pursuit</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Peering above the grass and brush which concealed
him, Gonch could see dimly and afar between
trees, the form of a great beast smashing its
way through the forest. His blood chilled at the
sight and then became ice as he caught a momentary
glimpse of a man’s face high above the trunk
and tusks of a gigantic elephant. He turned to
the lad beside him. Kutnar had not yet seen, nor
must he see. Crash! the flat blade of the Muskman’s
flint-ax descended upon the boy’s skull.
Kutnar stiffened and lay as still as a log.</p>

<p>The noise in the forest had by this time become a
cyclonic fury of breaking tree trunks and snapping
branches. A voice which sounded in Gonch’s ears
like that of an avenging fiend, jabbered and shouted
hideously in a language he could not understand.
He raised his head just high enough to see as the
hurricane swept past him, a huge elephant tearing
along with great swinging strides and using his
head as a battering-ram, while a man of herculean
build sitting astride his neck and clinging tightly
to avoid being swept from his seat by the tossing
branches, urged the beast forward as with whip and
spur. It was Pic and the Mammoth. Gonch felt
so terrified at sight of them that he burrowed his
face in the dirt and cowered there, wishing he had
never been born.</p>

<p>As the Mammoth reached the river bank, he
checked his onward rush so abruptly that had not
his rider been holding on tightly he would have
been pitched over the beast’s head. At a shout
from Pic, Hairi ransacked the ground carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
with his trunk-tip. Now that they were near the
water, some trickery was to be expected. However,
the Mammoth found the trail fresh and warm.
It led straight to the river, and so he splashed in.</p>

<p>Gonch waited until he heard the beast settling
into deep water; then raised himself on his elbows
and watched. The Mammoth climbed the opposite
bank and began a careful search for the trail. Pic,
who had been noting his steed’s every motion,
pointed to the bank downstream. Evidently he
suspected that the Muskman was once more essaying
the old water trick. He shouted a command,
the Mammoth wheeled, and the two of them disappeared.</p>

<p>Gonch turned his attention to the boy, who lay
as one dead. He raised him by the shoulders and
turned him over upon his back. The boy’s eyes
were closed. Blood trickled from his nose and
mouth; but he still lived. Gradually his breathing
grew stronger and he opened his eyes. He saw his
good friend bending over him.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he asked. “My head—the pain,”
and the Muskman answered softly. “With your
good Gonch, who drove away the beast that tried to
kill you.”</p>

<p>“The beast?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a lion, the largest I have ever seen. He
leaped through the trees and struck you down.
Would that I had received the blow instead of you;
but I did the best I could. The beast attacked me,
and I drove it away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Kutnar was still indisposed, and so Gonch raised
him in his arms and bore him away. To do this,
he was obliged to carry his ax in his jaws, holding
the handle between his clenched teeth. Not thinking
of nor seeing the boy’s ax, he left it lying where
it had fallen. Still holding Kutnar in his arms, he
marched to the river and waded through the shallow
water for a long distance. Finally, he went
ashore and entered the woods. Here he laid down
his burden and threw himself full length beside it,
so that each might feel the other’s warmth. In this
manner they passed the night undisturbed. Both
rested well, and when morning came Kutnar felt
sufficiently recovered to be up and on his way once
more.</p>

<p>Gonch was careful not to cross the river, following
the right bank instead until they were within
sight of the seacoast. Then they crossed the river
and ascended the elevations marking the western
end of the Pyrenees. From there they deviated
westward and entered upon the last leg of their
journey along the northern flank of the Cantabrian
mountain chain. This last leg was, however, not
the least, for by this time winter was in full blast,
bringing ice and snow with it and bitter north winds
sweeping down upon the exposed country lying
between the Pyrenees mountains and the Cavern
of Castillo.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<h2>XIII</h2>

<p>The Woolly Rhinoceros was left standing
on the right bank of the Dordogne River
watching Pic and the Mammoth disappear.
He had been ordered to remain behind,
simply because, through no fault of his own, he
lacked one cardinal virtue—speed.</p>

<p>But Wulli was not bewailing his speed, or rather
his lack of it. The subject never entered his head.
He was trying to grasp the idea that for the first
time in his long and adventurous career the Mammoth
had gone away and left him alone. As friends
they had always been inseparable. It seemed
incredible that anything could cleave their bond
asunder. What was one without the other? Wulli
had never imagined the possibility of separation.
It had always been “we”; now it was “I.” He
bowed his head, stunned, crushed as the terrible
reality dawned upon him—he had been left alone.</p>

<p>This was Thought Number One. His brain,
being an unpretentious affair, gave room for only
a single idea at one time. No one can blame him
for that. Some space had to be sacrificed for nose-horn,
bumps and everything. Unquestionably he
could have thought as hard and fast as anybody
had he the gray matter to do it with. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
things had to be taken as they were, and this
Thought Number One consumed much time. The
sun had set and darkness came on before he finished
with it. Then occurred Thought Number
Two.</p>

<p>This concerned Kutnar, and although Wulli
would have blushed to admit it, he loved the boy
with all the unselfish devotion of a faithful dog.
He had known Kutnar ever since the latter was a
baby. He had known the father even longer. Pic
was the Mammoth’s particular man-friend; Wulli
preferred the boy. He feared, admired and respected
Pic, but he adored Kutnar. The Rhinoceros
grit his teeth angrily as he thought of the
lad now being spirited away by a stranger—one
Hyena Man whom no self-respecting animal would
look upon as a friend.</p>

<p>Stay behind? Well, he guessed not, and the
mere fact that Pic had so ordered made no difference.
He would follow where the Mammoth’s trail
led him.</p>

<p>It was now dark. So profound had been his
reflections that he failed to observe an animal
crouching in the grass. Something shot through
the air, brushing the hilt of his tail as it sped behind
him. Then followed a thump and a muffled screech
as the unknown struck the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Wulli turned quickly and lowered his nose-horn,
whereat the beast uttered a frightened caterwaul
and bounded away. It was the Cave Lion’s half-grown
son. Wulli gave a snort of contempt, then
turned away to the river and plunged in. He did
not expect to overtake the Mammoth that night
nor even the next day. It might take weeks,
months, even a year, but he was bound to find him
in the end.</p>

<p>All that night he kept on and the following day,
too, trotting or walking, but always moving and
taking almost no time to graze. He was not disposed
to waste precious moments, and so he fasted,
drawing heavily upon his reserve fat to nourish him
as he hurried along. The trail was an easy one to
follow, and he kept his nose to it with a persistence
that never faltered. That of the Mammoth was
fresh and unmistakable. There was the scent of
another grown cold and stale but the carrion odor
yet clung to it, and Wulli judged him who had
made it to be the Hyena Man. He got occasional
whiffs of a third and familiar element and finally
recognized it as belonging to Kutnar. The three
were traveling the same path in a southwesterly
direction.</p>

<p>Wulli had not gone far when he heard faint
sounds behind him and detected odors in the air,
both of which convinced him that he was being
followed. Being a keen tracker himself, he could
understand the possibility of others tracking him.
The sensation of being hunted by unknown enemies
made him nervous. Hyenas were annoying, but
nothing worse. Wolves—real hungry ones—scared
him as they scared everybody. A pack of half-starved
wolves was a serious matter, even for a full-grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
rhinoceros. It was hard to tell where they
would stop. Wolves or hyenas, which? The uncertainty
was most distracting. Wulli made up
his mind to choose some advantageous position and
wait until he found out.</p>

<p>It was sundown when he swam across a river and
stood in the shallows near its western shore. Those
who followed were now close behind him, so he
waded into the deeper water until all but the top of
his head and shoulder-hump were submerged.
There he stood motionless. Any casual observer
would have thought him a water-logged tree-stump
with a root—his horn—projecting from one end
of it.</p>

<p>Wulli waited patiently, patience being one of his
greatest gifts. At last he was rewarded by the
sounds of animals descending the opposite bank.
They were now entering the stream. It was too
dark to see them, but he could hear from the noise
they made that they were coming toward him. His
sharp ears caught faint murmurs as of water rippling
and babbling against strong swimmers.
There were several of the latter, judging by the
sounds made. Wulli’s suspicions became reality,
for soon he dimly distinguished three heads, keeping
close together and coming toward him. Even
in the dim light he recognized them in that short
distance. Grun Waugh the Cave Lion was in the
lead, followed closely by another smaller animal
like him. The third beast trailing behind was a
cave-hyena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, why did that stupid Rhinoceros come
here?” growled a voice. The voice was Scrag’s.</p>

<p>“Yes, Crocut, you neglected to tell us about him,”
grumbled the larger lion. “Now we have the Rhinoceros
to account for; that makes it different.”</p>

<p>“But he is alone,” the Hyena sniveled. “You
are two. It might have been worse.”</p>

<p>“We are three,” Grun Waugh sternly corrected.
“If you value the meat on your bones, you will be
wise and do your part.”</p>

<p>Crocut sighed deeply. He, the conscientious
objector, was plunging into the thick of battle
against his own free will. He shivered at the
thought.</p>

<p>By this time the three animals had reached shallow
water and were wading ashore. Wulli could
hear them sniffing along the bank. “Here it is,”
the Hyena announced. “I smell the Mammoth,
also the friend I told you of. There is another man,
too, but I find no scent of the Rhinoceros. Where
did he go?”</p>

<p>“Here he is,” said Scrag. Wulli thought himself
discovered and was preparing for emergencies,
when the young lion added bumptiously: “I have
his scent. It leads back to the water. He must
have known that I was after him, or he would not
have turned around and gone back to where he
came from.”</p>

<p>“Pest,” snarled his parent; “get out of the way.”
Scrag backed off and permitted Grun Waugh to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
sniff Wulli’s spoor. It was that of the Rhinoceros,
sure enough, and it led back to the river.</p>

<p>“Wow, how unfortunate; he must have escaped
us,” laughed the Cave Hyena, inwardly rejoicing.</p>

<p>“Let not that worry you,” Grun Waugh retorted.
“You will have your fill of fighting when we overtake
the Mammoth.”</p>

<p>“Ow!” yowled Crocut, and then he shut up like
a clam.</p>

<p>“The Rhinoceros has turned tail,” thought Grun
Waugh. “He came here and then went back again.
I am glad of that. One less; so much the easier for
us. The Rhinoceros is the worst of the lot—when
he is mad.”</p>

<p>Just to make sure he stood at the water’s edge
and gazed into the darkness. He saw nothing
there, nothing but a tree-stump protruding from
the river bed. He gave the signal and all three
hurried away on the Mammoth’s trail.</p>

<p>When Wulli felt assured that the Cave Beasts
were past hearing him, he emerged from his refuge,
shook himself and followed after.</p>

<p>The affair was now become complicated. There
were four elements, Wulli’s limit of mental arithmetic.
More than that number was beyond his
range. In times past he could count only two, the
Mammoth and himself. Then Pic became an
important factor in his life. This made three.
Finally Kutnar appeared, and his education was
complete. He could count four. This number
fitted the present situation. The Muskman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Kutnar represented No. 1 or the Pursued. Pic
and the Mammoth following after them were the
pursuers or No. 2. Grun Waugh and his gang
made No. 3. Wulli himself was No. 4. Nos. 3
and 4 had changed their relative positions, and now
Wulli was the tail of the procession. For some
unknown reason the Cave Beasts had injected themselves
into the affair, which, according to his way
of thinking, did not concern them at all. And yet
here they were and must be reckoned with. He felt
sure that they were planning some mischief. He
had considered himself as the object of their unwelcome
attentions, which now, because of the change
in the order of those pursuing, would fall upon Pic
and the Mammoth. The three villains might attack
his friends while the latter were unprepared. Wulli
resolved to take a hand in this hare-and-hound game
himself. It took him but a moment to pick up the
combined trail of all parties concerned; then with a
whisk of his tail he set himself in motion and went
trotting briskly away through the darkness.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h2>XIV</h2>

<p>Wulli was familiar with the habits of
cave-beasts. They traveled all night,
and their resting was done in the daytime.
He, too, traveled all that night,
but instead of following the trail he branched off
in a wide detour at his utmost speed. This forced
night march had as its object a return to the former
relative positions of the Cave Beasts and himself.
It was important that they be put back where
they belonged, assuming that they belonged anywhere.
To accomplish this, Wulli must overtake
and pass them before daybreak, for he knew that at
the first sign of light the Cave Beasts would slow
up. They would skulk and crawl because of their
aversion to being seen, thereby enabling the Rhinoceros
to find and assume his rightful position in
the line. It now remained for him to make good
use of the wee small hours and circumvent his enemies
without their knowing it. He proceeded to
act accordingly.</p>

<p>The sky was becoming streaked with gray when
Wulli arrived at the edge of a large grove. He
judged that he must be considerably in advance of
the Cave Beasts by this time, although his detour
was not yet completed, and he must cover considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
ground before he could feel positive of having
secured a safe lead. He plunged into and through
the woods as fast as his legs would carry him. Several
hours later he emerged upon the right bank of
a river. Good; so far his plans had carried perfectly.
The next thing was to pick up the Mammoth’s
trail. This, too, was finally accomplished
after a long search up the river bank. The scent of
his friend was mingled with that of the odoriferous
Hyena Man and Kutnar. He hunted everywhere
for news of the Cave Beasts, but found none. Evidently
they had not yet arrived. He had about
made up his mind to enter the river when he smelled
something that made him shiver. It was the odor
of blood. A careful search led him to a clump of
brush several rods from the bank. This place bore
the scent of two men—Gonch and Kutnar. The
blood was that of the boy. An ax lay near by. It
was a mere stone tied to a stick, but the handle had
a familiar smell.</p>

<p>Wulli groaned and almost collapsed. The boy
had been hurt, perhaps killed. It was too dreadful
to think of. His heart pounded like a hammer
within his chest as he nosed about, following the
Muskman’s tracks. They led to the river. All
trace of Kutnar had disappeared. Wulli bit his
lips and looked about him despairingly. What did
it all mean?</p>

<p>Then came the sound of snapping wood as of
branches pushed aside or trodden underfoot. The
Cave Beasts had arrived! Wulli hurried to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
river, plunged in and swam to the left bank. Here
he stood wrist-deep in the water and waited.</p>

<p>A huge head thrust itself from among the trees,
and then Grun Waugh’s huge form debouched
majestically upon the distant right bank. Scrag
and Crocut were close behind him.</p>

<p>“Two lions and a hyena,” thought Wulli. “Quite
a number for me to manage.” Scrag was but an
inexperienced cub and not much of a fighter, but
he might be counted on to do something in a pinch.
The Hyena was an unknown quantity. He appeared
larger and different from the ordinary
brand—a formidable adversary if he but knew and
would use his powers. He might do so, seeing that
his side was three against one. Grun Waugh was
a host in himself. The trio were now entering the
water. It was in Wulli’s mind to turn tail and flee
in the hope of overtaking the Mammoth. With the
latter’s assistance, Wulli felt no doubts as to the
result if Grun Waugh chose to force an engagement.
However, the Mammoth might be far away;
then the Rhinoceros would be overtaken and compelled
to fight the Cave Beasts all by himself. It
would be on ground not of his own choosing, he
remembered. The idea did not please him at all.
He decided to stay where he was. He stood motionless
in the shoals, watching the flotilla of heads
bearing down upon him.</p>

<p>When no more than a stone’s throw separated the
opposing forces, Grun Waugh suddenly uttered a
surprised roar and backed water. The Rhinoceros<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
blocked his way. He had taken for granted that
Wulli was in full flight, but now he realized his
mistake and at a most embarrassing moment. He
dared not venture farther, for there was something
suspicious in Wulli’s calm and receptive attitude.
Grun Waugh knew him of old and therefore considered
prudence the better part of valor. He deflected
his course slightly downstream. By this act
of courtesy he would avoid a collision with the Rhinoceros.
Not to be outdone, the latter shifted his
position to correspond. The Cave Lion found his
enemy waiting to meet him, head-on as before. He
growled with vexation, then turned and swam upstream.
This was hard, battling against the swift
current. Wulli kept pace with him. It required
little exertion on his part, walking as he did on the
river bottom. Grun Waugh snarled with rage.
The Rhinoceros was determined to give him a warm
welcome.</p>

<p>While their lord was vainly maneuvering for a
landing, Scrag and Crocut conducted themselves
in a most unbusiness-like manner. According to
recognized naval rules, one or both of them should
have outflanked the Rhinoceros while the latter
faced Grun Waugh. In that case Wulli would
have found himself in a most embarrassing position—attacked
on several sides at once. However,
Scrag and Crocut simplified matters by trailing
after their leader. It being Grun Waugh’s fight
and his part to do the dangerous work, the other
two let it go at that. It did not occur to any of the
three that this, their habitual practice, might be departed
from in the present instance. The two lesser
animals followed their leader, and whenever the
latter tried to land he found the Rhinoceros ready
and waiting for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Wulli Defies the Cave Beasts</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Grun Waugh felt terribly incensed. With all
his courage, he dared not advance and impale himself
upon that terrible nose-horn. He reviled Wulli
under his breath for his obstinacy, but that did him
no good. Then he tried threats, roaring loudly and
showing his cruel teeth. He was fearful to look
upon, but the Rhinoceros failed to appreciate this.
Having determined that he was pursuing the best
possible course, he refused to budge from it. Not
for an instant would he permit the Cave Lion to
enter shallow water and rest himself.</p>

<p>“Go away,” roared Grun Waugh. “We will not
hurt you this time, provided you stand aside and
let us pass.”</p>

<p>“Pass where?” asked Wulli in his blandest manner.
“Your home is behind you. You are going
the wrong way.”</p>

<p>“And you will not stand aside?”</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it,” replied the Rhinoceros.
“You do not belong here. Go home and take your
hyenas back with you.”</p>

<p>Scrag nearly had a fit as he heard himself thus
insulted. To be classed as a hyena was more than
he could bear.</p>

<p>“Pig!” he wauled, forgetting his paddling. His
head sank; the waters closed over it. When it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
reappeared, Scrag was blinded and half-choked,
also the starch was taken out of him entirely. He
was cold and tired and made up his mind then and
there that he could be of more service to the world
as a live lion than mere fish-food. He faced about,
wheezing and panting, and sailed away on his return
trip.</p>

<p>Crocut saw the young lion scudding past him.
He was suddenly reminded that his wind and
strength were ebbing fast. Just about enough fuel
left in his bunkers to carry him back where he came
from, so he, too, swung around and steered a
straight course homeward.</p>

<p>Thus was the Cave Beast squadron shorn of
much of its seeming strength. The battle was not
yet over, however, for Grun Waugh still persisted
in his efforts to effect a landing. But Wulli held
the bridgehead, and the Cave Lion, try as he would,
could accomplish nothing. Finally, he, too, gave
up, tired and discouraged and steamed away,
leaving the Rhinoceros in full possession of the
field.</p>

<p>Wulli remained at his post for some time to
make sure. When convinced that there was nothing
more to be feared from the Cave Beasts, he
again went about his business. For some time he
trudged back and forth in an agony of indecision,
but there seemed only one way to go—after the
Mammoth whose comfort he yearned for and sorely
needed. So he made that his choice, following untiringly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
over hill and valley, through glades and
across swiftly flowing streams.</p>

<p>His woolly coat was torn and shabby and nearly
every ounce of his superfluous flesh had been consumed,
when at last he came to great mountains, so
lofty their peaks seemed to touch the sky. He
groaned dismally. Cliffs and high places were the
last things on earth any rhinoceros would care to
meet. Wulli would have given half of his life just
then if the Mammoth and Pic had suddenly appeared
before him, homeward bound. He hated
mountains. They made him dizzy and weak at his
knees and elbows. He gazed despairingly at the
towering crests. The trail of his crony the Mammoth
led to them, clear and unmistakable. There
was no help for it. Wulli set his jaws tightly together,
and with many misgivings for his future,
plunged blindly and boldly upward among the
peaks and crags.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<h2>XV</h2>

<p>The left bank of the Midouze River was for
Pic the parting of the ways between himself
and his son. All trace of the latter had
vanished absolutely and completely. He
tried every known art of woodcraft but without
success. Search the river bank as he would, he
could find no sign of the missing boy. “The traitor
has made use of the water to play me a trick,” he
thought, but just what the trick was, he could not
determine. “He has fled to his country in the
southland,” he told the Mammoth. “If we continue
in the same direction as we have been going, we
will again find this Gonch following the straight
path.”</p>

<p>There was nothing left to do but pursue this
plan. Thus far, the Muskman’s flight had been on
a straight line to the southwest. It was reasonable
to presume that in time he would so continue. He
had doubled or side-stepped to avoid his pursuers,
but he must get back to the line in the end.</p>

<p>Heretofore the Mammoth’s nose or trunk-tip
had guided the way, but now that the trail was
lost, the responsibility for taking the right course
devolved on Pic. It was a case of direction, and so
he made use of his knowledge of the sun’s position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
at rising and setting, also other signs that good
woodsmen knew for determining where they wished
to go.</p>

<p>“I will find this man, even if I have to go to the
earth’s end to do it,” he vowed, and the way he
scowled boded ill for the Muskman. He guided
the Mammoth through the Midouze region across
another river, the Adour, to a low wet region where
traveling was most difficult. It was a veritable
network of brooks and rivulets with ponds, sloughs
and soft spots scattered promiscuously between.
From black muck and mud, the soil gradually
changed to marl, then sand and clay as the land
surface inclined upward. This latter was seamed
everywhere with tiny streams, through which flowed
the drainage from a more elevated region. The
two travelers were now ascending the slopes, leading
to a mountain range which barred their way,
extending in a long line from east to west.</p>

<p>At sight of the mountains, Pic said to Mammoth:
“The rough country lies before us. Among the
rocks and cliffs we will find where men live.”</p>

<p>But when he drew nearer to them, he was much
taken aback and his views underwent a decided
change. The vastness of what he saw was appalling.
The steep slopes rose to tremendous heights;
so high that many of the peaks were lost to sight
far above the clouds. The spaces or valleys between
them were filled with masses of snow and
ice, from which torrents of water gushed forth and
down the mountain sides, bringing great quantities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of sand and clay with them. At times, great chunks
of rock or ice detached themselves from high places
and came crashing down. The ground trembled
beneath their impact as though shaken by an earthquake.</p>

<p>To Pic, the sight and sound of all this was beyond
his power of understanding. He had lived
his life in the lowlands and knew little of mountains.
It was not cold—where he and the Mammoth
stood. Winter might be near at hand, but
the sun shone brightly and he could feel its warm
rays. And yet, there was ice, high above his head,
and ice meant cold, a discomfort he was unprepared
for. In his hurried departure from the Vézère
Valley he had not thought to bring a hide with him
as protection from the cold. There appeared to be
need of such protection if he scaled those mountains.
They were not homes of men. The southland must
lie beyond, and to reach it he must cross the mountain
barrier.</p>

<p>A stupendous undertaking; Pic could appreciate
the difficulty of such a task, or rather he could appreciate
only a fraction of the difficulty. “Do men
climb over such things or do they go around them?”
he asked himself. “Go around them,” something
within him answered. He gazed to the east; mountains
in a never-ending chain as far as the eye could
reach. Westward it was the same, except that they
seemed to taper off like the tail of a gigantic beast.
There was no guiding angel to watch over him and
say, “Turn west and skirt the mountain barrier;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
then all will be well.” The Mammoth could not
help him and Pic saw no way but to choose the
straightest, although most difficult, course. He
gave a command and Hairi marched straight ahead—to
the mountains towering above him.</p>

<p>Up, up and never down. At times the Mammoth
assumed an almost erect position, so steep was the
climb. Pic had to hold on tightly to avoid sliding
backward and off the beast’s tail. When night
came he was only too glad to stop and rest, snuggled
up close to his big friend to keep himself
warm. No use of wishing that he had a bison robe
to wrap around and protect his body. When day
came and the journey was resumed, he dismounted
and proceeded on foot, hoping that the exercise
would drive off the chill which made him shiver
from head to foot. Both he and the Mammoth
made frequent stops, for the higher they climbed,
the more quickly they tired. The long and arduous
ascent had by this time brought them into a rarefied
atmosphere—thin air—which imposed a severe test
upon their hearts and lungs.</p>

<p>Trees, bushes and other vegetation gave way to
evergreens as they mounted to the region of perpetual
snow, and finally these were left behind
them. Snow, ice and low rugged crests alone remained.</p>

<p>One line of these crests, projecting from the
hard-packed snow, extended for a great distance
across our travelers’ line of march. A second similar
rock backbone lay in the dim distance, running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
parallel with the first. Man and elephant were
crossing the intervening space, when suddenly the
Mammoth uttered a loud bellow and stopped short,
his feet bunched beneath him like four wooden
posts. “The ground! It shakes!” he squealed,
much alarmed.</p>

<p>Pic halted, bent low and held his ear to the
ground. The latter did tremble; he felt it. He also
heard a muffled rumbling roar that seemed to
originate in the bowels of the earth. He shivered,
but this may have been due as much to the cold he
felt as to fear of the unknown. He could offer no
explanation of the mystery. The Mammoth was
far more frightened than he was, so he coaxed and
teased the great beast, telling him there was nothing
to fear and that he must move on.</p>

<p>Hairi yielded after much persuasion, although he
now proceeded half-heartedly and timidly, for the
trembling ground inspired him with great dread.
He was soon treated to another unpleasant surprise.
The space between the two lines of crests
was a waste of hard-packed snow which became
broken up into hummocks and ice-blocks as the two
advanced. Again Hairi stopped and stood shaking
like a leaf as he caught sight of a long deep rent in
the snow-plain. It emitted a deep, booming roar—a
thousand Cave Lion voices rolled into one.</p>

<p>This was too much for the Mammoth’s overbalanced
nerves. He stopped and refused to budge.
He would stand there until he starved and the
hyenas could come and polish his bones, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
would never go near that hole which growled so
strangely. Pic advanced to the rent in the snow-plain.
It widened and deepened as he approached.
He saw a gleam of ice beneath the snow—no rock,
nothing but ice. The roaring grew louder. Pic
kept on, although almost overwhelmed by the
timidity that even brave men feel when confronted
by dangers they do not understand. A few more
steps and he stood upon the brink of the rent. He
sank to his knees, dizzy and scared almost out of
his wits. Down, down, down descended the cold
ice-walls to some unknown depth beyond the range
of human vision, where the roar of rushing water
echoed and re-echoed until it boomed like thunder.</p>

<p>Pic began to comprehend. The snow-plain was
an ice-field of tremendous depth; the rent was a
crack in the ice; and the booming noise came from
the water which flowed through the bottom of the
crack. These things could be seen by any one who
dared stand on the brink of the rent and look at
them, but although Pic had a clear head when moving
about cliffs and high places, the vast depth and
cold emptiness made him so giddy he could scarcely
stand.</p>

<p>The ice-rent or crevasse was thousands of feet
deep, an indication of the ice-field’s depth. The
two lines of crests were in reality the tops of lofty
mountain chains, their intervening space filled
almost to the top with slowly moving ice; a glacier
with a torrent of water flowing through its base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;" id="illus13">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">“He Sank to His Knees, Dizzy and Scared”</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Pic returned to the Mammoth and explained
matters as best he could. There was a deep crack
in the ice and the water running through it made
much disturbance and noise. He would not ask his
friend to jump over the crack; it was too wide for
that; nor would he ask him to go near it. All that
Hairi need do was to follow. Pic would lead him
around it and to a place of safety.</p>

<p>The Mammoth appeared much relieved and consented
to move on. Pic led him on a line parallel
to the crevasse until the latter ended in a pile of
shattered ice-blocks. Here the glacier’s surface
was much broken and the two friends were obliged
to watch their steps carefully on the slippery ice
to avoid bad tumbles. In one place the surface inclined
to form a chute or narrow slide, and Hairi
in particular had a slow, hard time of it reaching
the bottom. He and Pic were so busy finding their
way around the end of the crevasse that they had
neither eyes nor ears for that which followed in
their wake. It was a shaggy-haired animal with
nose held closely to the ground and following the
same route over which Pic and the Mammoth had
just traveled. Where the path turned at right
angles, the newcomer looked up and saw the
crevasse yawning in front of him. The sight threw
him into a panic. Away he tore like mad along the
ice-cliff squealing, “Oowee, oowee!” at the top of
his lungs. Once he slipped and fell terribly near the
dreadful gulf. He rose trembling with fear. His
vocal cords became paralyzed and he could not
utter a sound. He staggered toward the ice-hummocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
near the end of the crevasse, foam-flecked
and steaming with the dew of death. The ground
suddenly fell away in front of him and he began to
slide. Too late; he uttered a last despairing
squeak, then resigned himself to the inevitable, and
with eyes tightly shut, went skidding rapidly on his
downward flight to the unknown horrors awaiting
him.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<p>Pic and the Mammoth had passed around the
crevasse and were putting it behind them as
fast as they could when several shrill
squeals rang out and startled them nearly
out of their wits. Both stopped and looked back
up the incline they had just descended. The
sounds seemed to have come from the ice-blocks
and hummocks at the top. Hairi’s mouth was wide
open; his eyes were nearly popping from his head.
Man and elephant stood rigid, listening, but all
was now quiet. The squeals were not repeated.</p>

<p>“That voice,” said the Mammoth in an awed
whisper. “How strange. It seems as though I
had heard it before.” The two friends were still
staring up the slide, when suddenly, without a sign
of warning, a shaggy beast hove in sight at the top
and shot down like a toboggan. It stood upright
with feet spread far out. Had the creature’s legs
been longer so as to elevate its center of gravity, it
must have toppled over and tumbled ingloriously
to the bottom. However, its legs were like four
stout pegs. This made the weight hang low and
the downward glide was completed right side up.
As the newcomer coasted along the level, its speed
slackened and gradually it came to a stop. This
happened to be right in front of the two friends.
Here it stood, motionless, with eyes shut tight.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wulli! My own Wulli! Where did you come
from?” bellowed the astonished Mammoth, staring
as in a dream at his partner, whose dramatic arrival
had occurred so suddenly and unexpectedly.</p>

<p>The Woolly Rhinoceros did not respond. He
had made up his mind that he was falling into that
dreadful hole and would be dead when he struck
the bottom. He seemed to be sliding dreamily
through space, falling more slowly every moment
instead of faster as he should have done. The end
was surprisingly calm and peaceful, for he reached
eternity without a jar. Then sounded sweet music—the
voice of the one he loved best. His was a
happy journey to the golden gates, too unreal to
believe. He opened one eye. There stood Pic and
the Mammoth in the flesh. He began to feel grave
doubts. “Am I dead?” he inquired feebly. “If so,
cover me with stones and do not let the hyenas
eat me.”</p>

<p>He spoke in the hushed voice of a departed
spirit; that made it funny. Pic forgot his surprise
and laughed loudly. “What makes you think you
are dead?” he asked, and laughed again.</p>

<p>“I fell in that awful hole,” simpered Wulli, still
unconvinced. “Every bone in my body is broken,
and yet, strange to say, I feel quite comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” Pic demanded. “You only slid
down that hill and you are not hurt a bit. What
brought you here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Brought me?” Wulli shed his angel wings and
opened his other eye. “I don’t know,” he replied.
“My legs, I guess.”</p>

<p>“He must have followed us,” said the Mammoth,
his surprise fast changing to joy as he realized
that he was really looking upon the Woolly Rhinoceros.
“It is wonderful that we three can be
together again.”</p>

<p>“Four of us would be better,” Pic muttered
sadly. On being thus reminded of Kutnar, Wulli
assumed an air of the deepest gloom. He told of
his affair with the Cave Beasts and how he had
come upon the trail of the Hyena Man and the
smell of blood.</p>

<p>“Whose blood?” groaned Pic. His face had become
deadly pale.</p>

<p>“Kutnar’s,” Wulli replied. “Several drops were
on the ground. A stone-stick lay near them.”</p>

<p>Pic’s knees trembled. He spread out his hands
as though to save himself from falling. “Dead?
I can’t believe it,” he said in a dazed sort of way.
“Why should Gonch kill the boy? And yet—Agh,
I am so afraid. We were closing in upon them and
the miscreant may have murdered him to save himself.
You saw nobody?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Wulli.</p>

<p>“And there was not much blood?”</p>

<p>“Very little; almost none.”</p>

<p>“Strange,” muttered Pic. “The boy may be yet
alive. Then there is the ax; that puzzles me. Why
did not the traitor take it with him?” Thus he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
aroused hope in his own breast, but this soon
changed to depression. The next moment he
raged and cursed Gonch for killing his boy and
finally gave himself up to the deepest despair. The
two animals watched these changing moods, with
much concern. “I do not believe that the boy is
dead,” said Hairi trying to comfort him.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” added Wulli.</p>

<p>“Nor I.” This third voice was a mere squeak
and it seemed to come from the ground.</p>

<p>“Who said that?” Pic looked up at his friends,
then at the ice about him.</p>

<p>“I said it and I mean it,” squeaked the voice
again. It came from a little rat-like animal which
was sitting upon its hind legs a short distance away.
Its white fur made it almost indistinguishable from
the hard-packed snow. Pic was the first to see the
little creature. He pointed to it. His friends
stared as though they could not believe their eyes.</p>

<p>“Obi!” squealed the Woolly Rhinoceros.</p>

<p>“Wulli!” piped the midget in response.</p>

<p>The Mammoth’s trunk reached toward the
squeaks, whereupon he who made them ran up the
trunk and jumped off onto one of the huge tusks.
Here he perched bolt upright looking first at the
Rhinoceros then at the Mammoth, out of his small
beady eyes.</p>

<p>“It is Obi,” said Hairi delightedly. “How good
it feels to see him again.”</p>

<p>Obi the Lemming danced up and down like a
good fellow. He loved to be appreciated and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
now enjoying himself thoroughly. “You know
that I go wherever the ice goes,” he replied in his
thin voice. “Some think me good for nothing because
I am so small; but let me tell you something,
big Trog-man, friend of all animals. Your young
one has run away but he is alive.”</p>

<p>Pic could scarcely believe his ears. “Alive? how
do you know this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I saw him.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>Obi pointed a stubby paw westward. “He was
with a Trog-man who wanted to kill me. The boy
had that piece of skin he throws stones with. He
threw at me but he made a nice face and I knew
that he meant no harm. The stone flew wide and
so I got away.”</p>

<p>Glorious news! Pic grinned from ear to ear.
He howled and danced for very joy. The world
now appeared all sunshine, for Kutnar was alive.
Hairi caught the spirit of his master and endeavored
to imitate him, dancing up and down and
shaking his tusks so violently that the Lemming
was forced to jump off. He slipped on the ice
and sat down with a bump. Pic laughed, Wulli
squealed and Obi squeaked at the sight. Even the
Mammoth forgot how to look sad. He got upon
his feet again thereby throwing his friends almost
into convulsions. His fall had ripped a large
patch of wool from his trousers’ seat. He knew
nothing of this, which made it all the more comical,
seeing that the joke was on him. The whole world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
looked bright and gay just then. The crevasse
was screamingly funny; the booming torrent, sweet
music; and Pic solemnly vowed that the air had
grown quite warm. Everybody agreed to all of
this, simply because Kutnar was alive and now they
could go on their way again with light hearts to
look for him.</p>

<p>Finally when all were sufficiently quieted down
to talk matters over, Pic turned to Obi and said,
“Never will I forget the sunshine and comfort you
have brought us. Some day I may repay this service.
And now you must go with us and show the
way?”</p>

<p>The Lemming was greatly disturbed by this latter
suggestion. “Go with you?” he squeaked in
a most solemn manner. “No, that would not be
right. I just came from there. You have forgotten
that a Lemming cannot go to the same place
twice in one season.”</p>

<p>At this, Pic looked so disappointed, Obi really
felt sorry for him. “It would be dreadful for me
to go twice to the same place,” he explained. “I
go wherever the snow and ice is but I would die if
I covered the same ground twice. I really could
not think of such a thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Obi was a Scandinavian and a most conscientious
little animal. He was a tireless rover but like
the Mammoth and Rhinoceros, he preferred cold
to warm weather and only ventured south when
there was plenty of ice. He took his traveling
very seriously as though it were a most important
duty. Some animals believed it was he who arranged
the winter season, for no matter when and
where he appeared, there was sure to be ice and
snow behind him. Seeing that his scruples forbade
his accompanying the party to a region he had so
recently visited, he did the next best thing, giving
most careful instructions as to the route Gonch
and Kutnar were traveling. “If you fail to find
the way, ask any animals you meet and they will
set you right,” he said; and then it was good-bye
and good-luck to Obi and the party proceeded without
him.</p>

<p>The line of journey was now changed to the west
and slightly north. Apparently the Muskman had
not continued in a straight line but had turned due
west, thus avoiding the Pyrenees Mountains over
which our friends were now traveling. The passage
over these mountains was most difficult. Now it
was up, up until they stood far above the clouds
amid bleak wastes of ice and snow; then down,
down into the almost bottomless valleys with their
tangled shrubbery and swirling streams. So it
went with constant repetition until the party covered
more distance to the sky and back to earth
again than they did in a horizontal line. The
Woolly Rhinoceros in particular, found this sort
of touring most trying. It was not so bad going
up but the coming down part terrified him. He
was no mountaineer and he lost his head completely
whenever he realized that the ground beneath him
was no longer within easy jumping distance. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
such circumstances, he stopped and squealed like a
big booby, too frightened to move either up or
down. This failing soon made him a nuisance to
Pic and the Mammoth who were managing fairly
well and making no complaints. Finally when
Wulli balked for about the fiftieth time, the Mammoth
lost patience. The Rhinoceros stood in front
of him, squealing “Oowee, oowee!” and blocking
the way. He snorted impatiently, then seized Wulli’s
tail with his trunk as though to drag him to one
side, whereupon the Rhinoceros proceeded briskly
onward. Hairi released his hold and the Rhinoceros
stopped. The Mammoth took a fresh grip
and Wulli responded by moving on once more.
Most extraordinary! but Hairi asked no questions
and held on to his partner’s tail, for he saw that it
produced results. Pic who had been an interested
spectator, finally remarked: “Wulli is afraid of
falling. As long as you hold his tail, he will fear
no more.”</p>

<p>This was quite true. A simple remedy but the
cure was immediate and complete. The Rhino’s
tail was but a bit of frayed rope and would not have
withstood a fraction of his weight. Wulli’s new
sense of security may have been fancied but what
of it? The Mammoth held his tail and that was
enough. From then on, they got along finely, sailing
up and down without a hitch and whenever
Wulli showed symptoms of balkiness, the Mammoth
cured him instantly by taking a grip on his
tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>They met the Chamois and the Ibex and the
Snow Grouse, one after another, and learned that
they were following the right path. The two first-named
animals knew the direction only in a general
way but the Snow Grouse flew about a great deal
and kept himself well informed as to what was
going on. From him, Pic learned that a tribe of
cave-men lived far to the east on that side of the
mountains which faced the sea. By continuing due
west, the party would pass along the southern or
opposite side of these mountains. Here they would
be protected from the bitter winds and could cross
to the north side at the proper time.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>

<p>Winter had descended upon the mountains
and valleys of northern Spain.
Snow covered the slopes and lowlands.
High above the ice-bound surface of the
River Pas, opened the Cavern of Castillo, near
whose entrance, Totan and his band were gathered
about a roaring fire. Skin garments now relieved
their summer nakedness. These were no more than
untrimmed hides fastened about their bodies, hair
outward. They were much frayed and blotched
with bare patches which gave them an extremely
shabby appearance. These garments had seen
more than one winter season, for hides were scarce.
The hunting had grown worse and worse and many
a hide had been chewed and swallowed for the small
nourishment it contained. The Men of Castillo
in their penury were driven to eating the very
clothes off their backs for the want of something
better. Even the hyenas had packed up and gone
away from a country that offered such poor pickings.
Nobody regretted their absence. There was
no need for scavengers or undertakers. The Men
of Castillo attended to such matters, themselves.
Whenever a man died, his companions made the
funeral arrangements their duty and an occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
for general rejoicing, using the corpse itself as material
for the funeral feast.</p>

<p>At times, parties of men would detach themselves
from the fire and sally forth in search of game.
Rarely did they come back with anything worth eating.
The little they did kill was poor enough and
they ate it then and there. Not infrequently, a
band would return numbering one or two less than
when it set forth. At such times, those returning
would appear well-fed and contented and would
curl up by the fire to rest and aid their digestion.
It was a case of each man for himself. He who
hungered, must go forth and hunt his food. If
he perished from weakness or exposure or was slain
by wild beasts, his troubles were ended and his companions
devoured what was left of him.</p>

<p>Totan and a dozen of his followers had but recently
returned to Castillo from one of these hunting-trips.
They and the rest of the band were now
gazing down the mountain side at two men near its
base who were slowly ascending. Even at that distance,
Totan recognized one of the newcomers.
“Gonch!” he exclaimed in surprise. “I thought
him dead long before this. And who is it that I
see with him? It must be the Mammoth Man,
maker of wonderful flints.”</p>

<p>When the pair had completed two-thirds of the
ascent, their forms and features could be easily distinguished
by those watching from above. All recognized
Gonch. The one with him was but a boy.
A murmur of voices broke the stillness. Totan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
scowled and gnashed his teeth until his jaws
cracked. “I fear that our comrade will be disappointed
with the welcome we give him,” he growled.
“It will be a warm one.” He looked knowingly at
the fire as he said this, meanwhile licking his lips
and grinning like a hyena.</p>

<p>Gonch arrived at the end of his long climb and
stepped upon the cave-threshold. The boy Kutnar
stood behind him. No shouts nor other noisy welcome
greeted his appearance. He brought no food
and his companion was a boy—not a man as might
have been expected.</p>

<p>Such a reception was no more nor less than
Gonch had anticipated and he was prepared for it.
Neither his wit nor courage had deserted him and
he now saw the need of both.</p>

<p>“I have come back as I promised,” he began
boldly. “The journey has been a long one. I have
survived much danger and suffering but I am here
and alive.”</p>

<p>“Alive? Yes, for a time,” said Totan in as
honeyed a voice as a bear would be capable of.
“We see that you have brought the Mammoth Man
with you. The journey must have been too much
for him. He appears to have shrunken. No doubt
you can explain why.”</p>

<p>“Young he is but more than match for our best
hunter,” Gonch replied without flinching. “None
can equal his skill with the fling-stone. If you do
not believe, try him.”</p>

<p>Everybody laughed, not with genuine humor but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
in the only way these savage men knew how to
laugh. One of them, a young fellow barely out of
his teens, strutted forward and sneered in Kutnar’s
face. Up to this time, the latter had remained a
passive listener and spectator, staring curiously at
the throng but at the sound of taunting laughter
and the sight of him who sneered, he drew back and
scowled angrily.</p>

<p>“A match!” roared the hetman springing to his
feet. “Into the cave, every one of you, and give the
youngsters plenty of room. Let the Stone
Thrower try him. If he fails, I will be the first to
pick his bones.”</p>

<p>Thus cautioned, the Castillan tyro selected his
best stone and placed it carefully in the cleft end
of his fling-stick. Kutnar did not hesitate, even
though this was his first test in single combat. In
a moment he saw what was expected of him. Quick
as lightning, he unwound the thong from his waist
and set a pebble in place.</p>

<p>“Good,” muttered Gonch between his clenched
teeth. “The boy bears himself like a true warrior.
I would be his friend if I could be anyone’s. No
man, young or old, lives who can best him at his
own game.”</p>

<p>Totan was now in fine spirits. This was good
sport, a fight to the death, although rough and tumble
with stout cudgels and grown men would have
been better. Stone-throwing was child’s play but
there was novelty in such a contest and it might
prove entertaining. He hustled his followers out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of the way into the cave-entrance and thus gave the
two gladiators the whole threshold to themselves.
Kutnar took his place at one extremity of the ledge;
the Stone Thrower stood at the other. The spectators
howled joyfully; then at a sign from Totan,
all became quiet.</p>

<p>Swish! The Castillan drew back his arm and
made the first throw—not badly aimed but Kutnar
saw the stone coming and dropped flat. The missile
whizzed over his head. Instantly he was up
again, whirling his sling. Hiss! the pebble sped
like a bullet. No chance to dodge a thing like that.
Before the Stone Thrower could tell what struck
him, he lay sprawling upon the ledge. His skull
was cracked but there was no more than a bruise
upon his temple to show for it.</p>

<p>Nobody laughed this time. All stared in wonder
at the fallen man, then at the boy. Kutnar had
no eyes for those about him. He stood motionless,
mouth half-open, watching the contortions of his
victim. This was the first human being he had
slain. A fair fight and not one of his choosing but
his triumph was tinged with remorse. It was with
such feelings that he crossed the ledge and stood
over the vanquished. Every pair of eyes followed
him. Every voice was hushed. The stillness of
death was in the air. And then as every Castillan
waited breathless anticipating the final blow, the
victor kneeled upon the rock and rubbed his foeman’s
forehead.</p>

<p>A chorus of astonished grunts arose. Kutnar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
heard the sound of bare feet scraping on the ledge
behind him. He looked around and saw the giant
hetman.</p>

<p>“Well done,” growled the Castillan leader.
“Even though it were a lucky stroke, a boy who
can use a toy like that must be good for something.
And yet you are but a child. The Mammoth Man
is not a child.” As he said this, he scowled at
Gonch who was standing near. The latter made
haste to divert his chieftain’s mind.</p>

<p>“The boy is a skilled hunter,” he explained.
“He can kill food enough for a dozen men. If
you do not believe, try him.”</p>

<p>The cave-men were now gathering about the lad,
pointing at both him and the sling he held. By
look and act it was clear that they were deeply impressed
with the way he had borne himself. Even
the hetman eyed him approvingly. “Here, you,”
he said to the men nearest him. “Take him down
to the river and see what he can do.”</p>

<p>The boy gazed longingly at the fire. He felt
cold and tired. He would have given almost anything
for a chance to warm his body and rest himself
but this could not be. Those chosen to escort
him were already descending the mountain side
and beckoning him to follow. Kutnar looked appealingly
at Gonch, but the latter’s back was turned,
so he merely sighed and went away with the cave-men
for a test of his skill at food-gathering.</p>

<p>When the party had taken itself off, Totan led
the Muskman to one side. “Son, did you say?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
But that does not make him the father. What has
become of the Mammoth Man? You promised
to bring him with you.”</p>

<p>Gonch gave a brief account of his doings in the
Mousterian country and his dealings with Pic, the
Weapon Maker. He described the latter as a hetman
too, but made no mention of his physical
powers.</p>

<p>“A hetman?” Totan lifted his eyebrows, then
scowled darkly. “He would be no more than a
flint-worker here. But you have not yet said why
he failed to come with you.”</p>

<p>“I used the boy as a lure,” chuckled Gonch.
“The Mammoth Man is following to rescue him.
The son is a prize in himself but before long we
will have the father too.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” Totan grumbled. “But I would
have preferred the man. You should have brought
him with you to make sure.”</p>

<p>“More easily said than done,” the Muskman replied.
“No man could force him to do anything
against his will.”</p>

<p>“No man?” The hetman scowled with wounded
pride and jealousy of the unknown champion.
Gonch gazed at him vindictively.</p>

<p>“He would yield to no man, for no man is
stronger or braver than this giant weapon maker.
He is mightier than the Cave Lion, larger than
yourself and——”</p>

<p>“You lie,” roared the now thoroughly aroused
hetman, beating his bristly chest with both fists and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
displaying his great bull-teeth. “No human being
is my equal. I could eat your lion-man.”</p>

<p>Gonch exulted inwardly although he was careful
not to betray his true feelings and draw the other’s
rage upon himself. “You might find him a big
mouthful,” he said. “This weapon maker can
crush men’s bones in his hands. I have felt his
grip. Never have I known such power. That is
why I used trickery to bring him here. Such a
big strong man.” Gonch lowered his voice and
said, “Perhaps it is well that I did not bring him.
It is not yet too late. He may be induced to return.
We can send the boy to him and——”</p>

<p>“Ar-r-r!” Totan’s face swelled and reddened
as though it would burst. He was no coward and
the knowledge that there existed a foeman worthy
of his steel, only aroused his fighting spirit. He
was like a pit-dog held in leash, all aquiver with
waiting for the joy of blood and battle. For a
moment, the fight-lust nearly robbed him of speech.</p>

<p>“Bring me this man,” he snarled in a choking
voice. “He is mine—mine; I will tear him to
pieces with my teeth and eat his living body. Bring
him to me and quickly. I cannot wait.”</p>

<p>“Have patience; he will soon come,” was the answer.
Totan could only glare and pant. He listened
sullenly as Gonch told of Pic’s pursuit. The
Mousterian weapon maker was like a lion robbed
of its cub. He would come; no doubt about that.</p>

<p>The hetman was only partly appeased. There
was some pleasure in his feelings of anticipation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
but he felt a consuming impatience to get the Lion-Man—as
he called him—within his reach. His fingers
itched for him so, he could hardly wait.</p>

<p>“But the Lion-Man might not come,” he growled
irritably. “In that case, I am sure that things will
go hard with you.”</p>

<p>Gonch pretended not to see the implied threat
as he answered, “Do not worry. He will come,”
and there the conversation ended, for although
Totan fretted and fumed, he saw that he could
do nothing but wait and give Gonch the time needed
to make good his promise.</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>

<p>On the way down the mountain side, Kutnar
had an excellent opportunity to gain a better
knowledge of his new acquaintances.
His first impressions were far from flattering.
A more squalid, beast-like lot of men he had
never seen. He mistrusted them at sight. On his
long journey to the southland he had anticipated
much pleasure in meeting them and learning about
their superior flint industry. The latter was as disappointing
as the men themselves. Fine weapons?
Never had he gazed upon worse. He saw not a
single flint ax-head or poniard; in fact, no stone implements
with the exception of a few badly-hewn
quartzite flakes. Apparently the Castillans relied
almost entirely upon wood. Their clubs, javelins
and fling-sticks were all made of this material.
Even it was badly chosen and shaped. Kutnar
made a wry face as he looked at his companions
and their miserable equipment. “These cannot be
Gonch’s people,” he finally consoled himself.
“Soon we will pass on to the country of the southrons
and the sooner, the better.”</p>

<p>Deep down in his heart, Kutnar knew that it was
not a sight of the southrons nor their flint workmanship
that he really craved. A quick turnabout and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
a trip homeward would have pleased him more than
anything on earth. He was terribly homesick. It
seemed ages since he had run away from father and
friends. The knowledge that he had so recently
slain a fellow-being, added to his depression. He
thought of Totan and that reminded him of Pic.
Both were strong men but there the resemblance
ended. His father had a heart; the Castillan hetman
appeared to possess none. “I have at least
one good friend near me,” the boy remembered.
Gonch was there and that gave him great comfort.
“I am no longer a baby,” he thought, so he determined
to bear up patiently until the time came for
the long journey homeward.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the party had reached the end of
their descent and were making their way across the
lowland to the River Pas. Suddenly one of the
men grunted and all stopped short. He who had
signalled said to Kutnar in a low voice, “A hare!
Quick boy; now is your chance to show what you
can do.” The sling was loaded and ready before
the man had ceased speaking. Kutnar moved
noiselessly ahead of his companions to within
throwing range. Whizz, sped the stone and a big
snow-white hare leaped from a clump of bushes and
bounded away. “A miss,” one of the hunters
sneered as the boy glided forward like a cat. They
saw him reach down among the bushes and then
stand erect holding some animal by its long ears—a
hare. There had been two. The one first seen
had escaped but Kutnar had bagged the second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Kutnar Bags a Hare</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The cave-men were astounded. This was indeed
fine shooting but there was more to follow. The lad
flung his quarry to them and then went speeding
across the snow-plain after hare Number One.
The cave-men followed closely and were treated to
a lesson in stalking which opened their eyes. Hare
Number One had not fled far. His tracks were
easily seen in the snow and it was not long before
Kutnar saw him lying in a ball and trusting in his
protective coloring to escape unseen. But this
availed him nothing. He waited too long for his
next jump, thinking he had but a fling-stick to deal
with. He too was bagged and the boy found himself
the center of the most thoroughly surprised
lot of men that one would hope to see.</p>

<p>“He is not of this world,” said one of the band.</p>

<p>“Nor is his fling-string,” said another. “He has
but to wave it and animals drop to the ground
dead.”</p>

<p>These and other remarks, Kutnar listened to and
they pleased him, for he was but a boy and relished
the compliments of men. They made him feel as
though he were a man too. Another hare was
sighted and bagged and thus the hunt went merrily
on. Kutnar even tried his skill on a young boar.
He did not kill the animal but he disabled it so
that the hunters could easily complete the work
he had begun. When the party turned homeward,
they took with them four hares, three grouse and
the boar; and Kutnar had killed them all. A wonderful
bag; all were agreed on that; and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
agreed too that as a hunter and provider, Kutnar
was worth his weight in the finest flints ever shaped
by mortal man. When they arrived at Castillo and
Totan learned of Kutnar’s success, he was mightily
pleased. “If the boy can thus shame our best hunters,
what could not the grown men of his tribe do?”
he thought. This reminded him of the Lion Man
and he revelled in the thought of what would happen
if the latter would only come within his reach.</p>

<p>The Muskman’s star was again in the ascendancy.
The boy had been tried and found all that
any hunter could wish. Were these men jealous of
his prowess? Certainly not. No half-starved
beast or human being looks askance at the hand that
feeds it. One and all praised his skill with the
fling-string. Boy or no boy, he was certainly a
godsend to these half-famished men and they were
not backward in saying so. Some of them went so
far as to volunteer their services to keep him supplied
with the finest pebbles. They were not the
ones to permit his ammunition to run low. They
even gave him the hide of the boar he had killed.
A chilled body might result in a stiff arm which
would prevent accurate shooting and of course that
would never do. In fact they were anxious to do
anything for the lad that promised to improve their
own health and comfort.</p>

<p>There was some satisfaction in finding himself
welcome even among these savage men but in spite
of that, Kutnar felt homesick and uneasy. “Why
do we continue to stay here?” he asked the Muskman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
but the latter merely answered: “Be patient.
It is for a short time only. When the snow melts,
we will be on our way again.” Kutnar forced himself
to be content with this. He was but a boy who
respected men and revered his friends. Gonch was
his man-friend and it never occurred to him that
the Muskman was playing him false; and so he did
his part, which was no small task for now that his
skill was known, he did more than half the hunting
for the whole band. In addition to his skill with
the sling, he possessed no mean knowledge of woodcraft,
showing his companions many things about
tracking and trapping game that they knew nothing
of. Kutnar became leader of the hunters; that is,
he did most of the work. The pebbles flew straight
and far from his sling and there was both speed and
force behind them. For their part, the cave-men
who accompanied him on his hunting trips, did little
more than watch him open-mouthed and retrieve
the game he killed, like a pack of dogs. Kutnar
deep down in his heart, despised these men as he
did their weapons. Of them he had more to learn
and also something that greatly changed his opinion
of his good friend Gonch.</p>

<p>The latter was present one morning on one of
the hunting-trips. It chanced that on this same
morning a mighty hunter had descended from the
foot-hills and was engaged in stalking a boar, grubbing
about in the snow on the left bank of the River
Pas. Kutnar and his band of cave-men had observed
this boar but not the mighty hunter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
foot-hills. Both sets of stalkers closed in upon
their intended victim, who finding himself too much
hunted, ran squealing away leaving his persecutors
to face each other. A tawny body shot from the
bushes and in a flash, one of the cave-men lay upon
the ground beneath the paw of a huge lion. Kutnar
was in the van of those who by much shouting
and waving, so bewildered the big cat that it relinquished
its victim and crawled away. The man
was still alive although badly mauled. “Friends
should ever help each other,” ran through Kutnar’s
brain as he bent over the unfortunate and wiped the
blood from his face with a bunch of leaves. Not
that the man was his particular friend, but his heart
was filled with pity at sight of a fellow-being in distress.
Suddenly he was dragged to his feet and
thrust roughly aside. He turned and faced Gonch.</p>

<p>“Stand back, boy; do not meddle,” cried the
Muskman and then before Kutnar knew what his
friend was about, the latter despatched the wounded
man with a blow of his ax. Then as though this
were not enough, he was the first of the hunters to
spring upon the body with teeth and hands. As
the boy looked on in horror at the man-pack snarling
and devouring their dead comrade, the cobwebs
fell from his eyes and he saw the Muskman in his
true colors, a hyena-man unfit for the friendship
of human being or beast. It was a terrible blow.
He felt his life robbed of its last sweet essence. By
that one act, Gonch had in a flash lost the right to
trust and friendship and now in Kutnar’s eyes he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
was a loathsome, detestable thing, more so than the
meanest of his fellows.</p>

<p>Gonch was quick to see the change in the youth’s
feelings toward him but he was growing careless
with rising fortune and felt no need of making further
effort to mask his true nature. “Flesh is flesh,”
he leered in the boy’s face when the horrible orgie
was over. “You will soon learn that man’s flesh is
as good or better than any other.”</p>

<p>Kutnar spat in disgust. “When am I to leave
here?” he cried. “I hate these men and—and now
I hate you.”</p>

<p>“Leave here?” sneered Gonch. “Impossible. I
could not bear such a calamity. My people dote
upon you. I am quite sure that they could not live
without their youthful hunter.”</p>

<p>This last sentence contained much truth. The
Muskman felt its humor and he chuckled at his own
wit; but the boy only glared.</p>

<p>“Your people? Then this is what you have
brought me to. These wretches are the fine people
of the southland. Tell me, filthy beast-man, why
am I here?”</p>

<p>Kutnar held his sling threateningly. He was
furious. The cave-men were now gathering around
the pair. “Be quiet, boy,” the Muskman warned
in a low voice. “A word from me and the flesh
will be torn from your body. You hate me. Good;
but take care.”</p>

<p>That was all but in that short time, the boy in
some ways had become a man. He said no more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
only hung his head, crushed and humiliated with
disappointment and revulsion of feeling. It was
the sudden shattering of an ideal. Now he had no
friends, for the one man whom he had trusted and
befriended was a cannibal and traitor doubly vile.
He returned to Castillo with the others and chose
a spot by the fire as far removed from Gonch as
possible and sat there staring vacantly into the
blaze. The shades of night settled over the mountain
and still he sat motionless, oblivious to what was
going on about him. One by one the cave-men retired
to Castillo’s yawning entrance and curled up
in their hide-wrappings to secure their night’s rest.
All were gone but two—the boy and Gonch.</p>

<p>“You who perform one task so well, can bear
another,” the Muskman sneered. “Watch the fire,
and watch it well until the light returns. Do not
fall asleep or it will be the worse for you.”</p>

<p>These were Gonch’s parting instructions and
then he too lay down in the cave-entrance. Kutnar
smiled bitterly. Another task was now added to
his already overburdened shoulders; one that no
man dared neglect. Without fire, life would have
been impossible during the cold season. The roaring
blaze warmed and cheered many a body which
without it would have succumbed sooner or later to
rheumatism, influenza or other virulent disease.
Fire, a most difficult thing to create, was rarely permitted
to die out. The Castillans took turns watching
and feeding it day and night. Woe to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
who neglected his all-important task, a task that
Kutnar was now obliged to assume.</p>

<p>But he neither rebelled nor complained. He was
but a boy long accustomed to obey and respect his
elders; and ingrained habits are slow to change.
And yet as he gazed silently at the lashing flames
and curling smoke-wreaths, his mind was experiencing
one of those tremendous upheavals that, like
the volcano or hurricane, preface their fury with
outward calm. Kutnar was deadly calm. His
thoughts surging one upon another were those of
a sane and sober mind. But with all his illusions
shattered, the child was become a man. He now
knew that all of the southland wonders were the
Muskman’s lies. There were no fine flints, no
weapon-making; the men might have been wolves
except for their human forms which however made
their wretchedness and cannibalism even more
beast-like in his eyes. So low had they fallen that
they must needs depend upon himself, a mere boy,
to feed them; but most dreadful of all was the
knowledge that his best friend had sunken lower
than any of them and had betrayed him from first
to last.</p>

<p>As he watched the dancing firelight, bestirring
himself at intervals to pile on fresh wood, the boy’s
mind was saying, “I must do my best to be useful
and earn the right to live. Brighter days are in
store for me if only I will be patient and wait for
them” and beneath this rumbled the voice of the
man-mind, low and distant but ever coming nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and nearer: “I despise these men; but he who has
deceived me, I hate and loathe. Filthy beast-man
whom I once called friend, the time will come when
you must pay the penalty. When the sling sends
you my message; listen to the stone-hiss, ‘Greetings
from my master, son of the Mammoth Man. He
bids me fly straight and fast, bearing to you his
traitor-friend the reward that you have so nobly
earned—death.’”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<h2>XIX</h2>

<p>It was not many days before Gonch found himself
subjected to increased pressure. The
grim hetman fretted and chafed incessantly
simply because the Lion Man failed to appear.
With all his sharpness, Gonch had merely relieved
one bad situation by creating another. He was
congratulating himself for his shrewdness in diverting
Totan’s channel of wrath to someone other than
himself, but now that the Lion Man had become
rooted in the hetman’s mind, Gonch found himself
worse off than ever. Pic did not appear. There
were no others worth while to soothe Totan’s pugnacious
spirit, so he centered the burden of his rancor
upon Gonch.</p>

<p>“Time passes and still your Lion Man does not
come,” he fumed. “I believe you lie when you say
he will.”</p>

<p>“And I still say so,” replied the Muskman although
in a less cocksure manner than formerly,
for he was beginning to feel grave doubts. “But
the lad; does he not please you? Never have we
fared so well as since he came here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;" id="illus18">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Hetman Loses Patience</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Totan gave his henchman a sour look. “Lad?
Ugh; he does better than all the rest of you put
together. But bah! why speak of him? I want
none but his father the Lion Man, Weapon Maker
or whatever else you choose to call him. I hunger
to crush his bones.”</p>

<p>Gonch sensed the approaching storm. He
grasped desperately at a straw. “Weapon
Maker?” he whispered looking carefully around
him as though he were about to impart some deep-dyed
mystery. “You ask for him who makes the
fine blades? Pst! he is here.”</p>

<p>“The Lion Man?” roared Totan, leaping to his
feet and snatching at his club. “Where?”</p>

<p>“Son of the Lion Man, you mean,” corrected
Gonch. “It is my little secret. He makes the fine
weapons even better than his father. What a prize;
a hunter and flint-worker, all in one.”</p>

<p>“Agh! the boy again,” howled the hetman in a
great rage and then his curiosity got the better of
him as Gonch hoped and half expected it would.
“The boy a flint-worker?” he sneered. “This is another
of your lies; but you have said it and I will
know the truth, even if I have to eat it out of you.”</p>

<p>“Try him,” said the Muskman much relieved that
he had so neatly turned the trend of conversation.
“I said and proved that he was the equal of our
best hunters. I say and will prove that he is a
skilled flint-worker. To-morrow he will begin
making the fine blades.”</p>

<p>“And a sorry day it will be for you if he fails,”
snarled the giant enraged at being so easily diverted
from the main idea and yet not having wit enough
to stick to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>And so the storm-clouds lifted temporarily, giving
Gonch a chance to keep his hide on him and him
in it. He sought Kutnar and said, “Those who do
nothing, shall eat nothing. You idle too much.
Now is the time for you to hammer and finish the
fine flint weapons. You know how the work is
done. We must have blades. Make them.”</p>

<p>And so more was required of him. Kutnar’s eyes
glittered as he answered, “But there is no flint here.
Blades cannot be made from nothing. Find me
flint-lumps if you must have the tools.”</p>

<p>“Find them yourself,” snapped the Muskman
irritated by the boy’s reply. “If you fail, I will
see that you get no food.”</p>

<p>So Kutnar did as he was bidden or tried to at
least. It was past mid-day and he would have welcomed
a rest after his morning’s hunting trip. The
blood was surging to his temples but the boy-mind
still ruled and so he went down to the river bank
to search the gravels for material on which to work.
But he found only disappointment, for the waters
were ice-bound, and even if flint-lumps were there,
he could not reach them. He returned to Castillo
just before nightfall, and of course he returned
empty-handed. Gonch scolded him soundly, even
as he trembled for his own safety at thought of
what the morrow might bring when Totan learned
of his failure. He jerked the boar-hide loose that
Kutnar wore about his body and hissed, “No food
nor warmth either for him who does nothing. You
shall pay by taking a turn at fire-watching to-night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
To-morrow will be your last chance. The blades
we will and must have.” He would have said
more but as he looked about him, he saw the giant
hetman watching and beckoning him to come that
way. Gonch went reluctantly, for he had a fair
idea of what was in the chieftain’s mind.</p>

<p>“The boy pays small attention to your orders,”
Totan said grimly when the two were together. “I
believe that you have grown careless. He is a flint-worker
but he works no flints. No doubt you lie
when you say he does.”</p>

<p>“Blades cannot be made from nothing,” was the
answer. “The lad cannot find the flint on which
to work.”</p>

<p>This was in part, repeating Kutnar’s own words
and the hetman’s reply was curiously enough word
for word the same as Gonch had given the boy.</p>

<p>“Find them yourself,” was his gruff response.
“I will have no excuses. The blades must be made
or no one knows whom we will be eating next.” He
leered so affectionately at Gonch that the latter
felt cold chills creeping up his spine. He determined
for his own health he would accompany Kutnar
on the morrow and help him find the flint-lumps.
He could not hold Totan off forever, for
the latter was already nearing the limit of his patience.
“If Pic would only come, my troubles
would be ended,” he thought. “These two giants
would destroy each other, leaving me master beyond
dispute.”</p>

<p>But Pic had not yet arrived and there seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
small chance of his doing so in time to improve the
situation. “To-morrow I will help the boy find the
flint-lumps,” he assured his chief. “He dare not
fail me this time. I will not let him out of my
sight until he secures the material and begins to
make the blades.”</p>

<p>Before curling up in his hide-wrapping, he gave
Kutnar his parting instructions: “Watch the fire
to-night. In the morning, you will join the hunters
in search of game. This done, we will go forth together
and find the flint-lumps. Before sunset you
must be at work making blades. Then, if you have
done well, another shall have a turn at fire-watching
and you may rest.” With that, he went his way.</p>

<p>Kutnar listened but said nothing. When he
could sit alone and gaze into the firelight, it was
the nascent man-mind that now whispered to him:
“Drudgery and death will be yours if you stay
here. Why serve them you despise and him you
loathe? Up, boy, and prove yourself a worthy son
of the Mammoth Man. Your friends are rushing
to your aid. Far in the distance behind the screening
haze, I see the form of a huge beast with long,
gleaming tusks, ploughing toward you through the
drifts. A mighty man sits astride his neck and a
stout shaggy animal trots by his side. Awake and
bite back at these yapping wolves or remain a slave
and see no more of father and people and your
friends the Hairy Elephant and Woolly Rhinoceros.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<h2>XX</h2>

<p>When Gonch arose next morning, he
found Kutnar piling fresh wood upon
the cave-hearth fire. The boy had been
awake all night, nevertheless he appeared
in good spirits. For some reason or other
this angered the Muskman and he curtly ordered
Kutnar to make ready for the morning hunt. This
in itself was a flagrant violation of the Castillan
code. Night fire-tenders were always permitted a
rest after their labors while others attended to the
next morning’s food-gathering. But this was an
exceptional case. Gonch found the hetman’s brow-beating
too much to bear and so he passed the burden
with his spite added, on to the boy.</p>

<p>And still Kutnar did not complain but made
ready as he was told. It would appear that he had
resigned himself to the position of menial and camp
drudge and would perform any work allotted him.
So it seemed, judging by his actions; but Gonch
was keen enough to see that the boy’s manner was
not quite the same. He appeared to have changed
over night. The change was in the look of his eyes.
Gonch recalled that same look in the eyes of a
wounded wolf he had once cornered. The beast
had sprung upon him and bitten him severely as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
approached to club it to death. The comparison
might be a product of his imagination, but Gonch
deemed it wise to take no chances. He would
watch the boy and be on his guard, for there was
no knowing what Kutnar might do if he once made
up his mind to do it. The main thing to guard
against was the sling. If the boy ever took a notion
in his head to attack anyone with it, no doubt he
would prove a dangerous customer. “A deadly
toy,” was Gonch’s opinion of it. “I will keep an
eye on the lad and see that he does not get a chance
to use it.”</p>

<p>Kutnar took his place as usual in the morning
hunt and Gonch accompanied him. No matter
where they tramped; through snowdrifts and over
hill and dale, whenever the boy looked behind him,
there was the Muskman standing close at his elbow.</p>

<p>It was past mid-day when the party returned to
Castillo. Kutnar had no sooner thrown himself
down by the fire to rest than the Muskman curtly
informed him it was time to descend to the bank
of the River Pas and search for flint-lumps. Without
a word, the boy rose obediently to his feet.
Gonch again observed the strange hunted look of
those eyes; also the jaws were set tightly together.
It was on his mind to take several of the cave-men
along too, for there was greater safety in numbers,
but he put this notion scornfully aside. “What a
fool I am to fear him and his fling-string,” he reflected.
“A mere lad who knows better than to pit
himself against a man”; but he was careful just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
same and kept his ax in readiness to strike down the
lad if he made a move to use the sling girt about his
loins.</p>

<p>In this manner they descended to the river bank.
Then began the search for flint-lumps, but in spite
of their diligence, they had no success. With the
passing of time, Gonch grew more and more desperate
as he thought of the trip back to Castillo
where he must face the hetman empty-handed.
“Look closer, boy,” he snarled. “If you fail, there
will be neither food nor rest for you to-night when
we return.”</p>

<p>Kutnar looked furtively about him, not toward
the ground but at the distant mountain of Castillo,
the snow-covered lowlands and up and down the
ice-bound stream. His hands fumbled with the
rawhide thong tied about his waist. In an instant
the Muskman’s ax flashed threateningly above his
head.</p>

<p>“And so the little boy would play with his fling-string,”
sounded Gonch’s taunting voice followed
by a fierce command: “Quick, give it to me or I
will kill you.” Kutnar’s nostrils swelled and his
face reddened but there seemed no help for him.
He loosened the sling from his body and cast it
at the Muskman’s feet. At sight of the youth now
completely disarmed and at his mercy, Gonch
laughed a loud brutal laugh charged with cruelty
and malice. “You hate me,” he hissed; “but your
hatred is a mere pebble beside yonder mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
compared with what I feel toward you. Do you
know why?”</p>

<p>Kutnar made no answer; merely glared at his tormentor
with hunted eyes.</p>

<p>“Because you are the whelp of the Mammoth
Man,” snarled Gonch. “He, your father, I hate
even worse than I hate you. You do not know
why.”</p>

<p>Again no answer; Kutnar only glared.</p>

<p>“Because he has the heart of a woman in his great
lion body,” Gonch raved on vindictively. “Because
he is a friend of beasts and would withhold them
from the paunches of hungry men; because he
would make weaklings of hunters and warriors; and
because of the strength in his lion body which prevented
my bringing him here a slave.”</p>

<p>Kutnar’s chest rose and fell with his hard breathing.
He bit his lips until the blood came; but still
he said nothing.</p>

<p>“I was but a wolf running amuck in his flock,”
the Muskman sneered. “A rock fell from the cliff
and nearly destroyed the Mammoth and Rhinoceros.
Who pushed it down? I. A man set upon
the Mammoth caught fast in the mire and would
have destroyed him, had it not been for the meddling
Rhinoceros. Who was that man? I. Who stole
the Lion Man’s cub when all chance of securing the
Lion Man himself was gone? I. Do you hear me,
whelp? It was I.”</p>

<p>The boy’s eyes were now blazing like coals of fire.
His face had become livid. Gonch noted the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of his cruel mockery and he gloated over it even as
he gloried in the boy’s helplessness.</p>

<p>“We were such dear good friends,” he scoffed.
“I loved you, my comrade, as a hyena loves a bone.
We fled to the southland together; you and I.
Your father pursued us. He rode upon the Mammoth
and soon we were overtaken. I thought it
unwise for you to know who was pursuing us, for
your father was angry and would have spoiled all.
We lay hidden in the bushes. Another moment
and you would have learned the truth, had not someone
struck you from behind. Who struck that
blow? A lion? No. It was——”</p>

<p>“You!” screamed Kutnar, and like a flash, he
launched himself at his tormentor’s throat.</p>

<p>So sudden and unexpected was the attack that
Gonch’s weapon was stricken from his hand. Now
he too was unarmed. Over and over they rolled
in the snow; first the man, then the boy uppermost,
clawing and biting like wildcats and without apparent
advantage to either. Gonch was howling
with fury but Kutnar fought silently like a weasel
and his hands ever worked for a weasel hold on his
foeman’s throat. Rough and tumble, kick, strike,
gouge; they struggled with all the strength and
fury of madmen. For an instant they separated
and each stood upon his feet. Gonch sprang to
recover his ax but Kutnar frustrated this attempt
with a quick leap that bore his detested enemy to
the ground. The Muskman’s guard was open and
Kutnar found the opportunity which he had long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
sought. Both hands clutched the Castillan’s throat
and clung there like death.</p>

<p>Over and over they rolled again. Gonch’s cries
were now screams of pain and rapidly losing force,
even as his struggles to free his neck from that tearing,
strangling clutch, became feebler and feebler.
Kutnar felt his foe weakening; he gripped the
tighter. Gonch’s body jerked convulsively, the
blood trickled from his nostrils, then he relaxed and
lay still. Kutnar released his hold and stood erect.
The Muskman never moved. “Men will soon know
of this,” the boy muttered; but there was no need
of their knowing it too soon, so he seized the body
by the shoulders and dragged it out of sight among
some neighboring bushes. This done, he recovered
his sling, also not forgetting to appropriate the
Muskman’s fine flint-ax for his own use; then he
was ready to proceed.</p>

<p>The die was cast and now there could be no turning
back. Sooner or later, the man-pack would be
after him. “To be caught is to be killed and to be
killed is to be eaten,” he thought and so he made
ready to escape with all speed. Which way?
There was the broad highway eastward across the
windswept snow-plain. It was the shortest route
back to home and friends. He gazed longingly in
that direction then shook his head. An endless
journey in the dead of winter; the attempt would
be madness. He could do it after the first spring
thaw but not now. There was no help for it; the
path pointing to the east meant cold, sickness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
death. He turned to the south. There lay the
mountains full of hiding places and caves no doubt
where he might live protected from the elements.
Food? His sling had killed for many; now it
could surely kill for one. Yes, he would flee southward
and take refuge among the mountains until
such time as the return of mild weather would permit
the long journey home.</p>

<p>He was making off along the line of the Pas
when he thought of the Muskman. Something
prompted him to look once more upon the body of
his enemy and for the last time. He retraced his
steps and entered the bushes. Gonch lay there
upon his back. As Kutnar gazed down at him, he
said in a melancholy voice: “The rogue has met his
just deserts; and yet—it is hard to forget that I
once looked upon him as a friend.”</p>

<p>He kneeled over the body and laid one ear against
the chest. “Can it be that he is still alive?” he
asked himself. “The heart still beats; the flesh is
warm.” The thought disturbed him. He raised
his ax. One blow and all doubts would be removed;
then for some reason he hesitated. “He will die
anyway,” the boy reasoned. “It would be but
striking a corpse.”</p>

<p>“That may strike back if you do not,” something
within warned him and he raised his ax once
more, only to lose heart when it came to actually
dealing the finishing stroke. “He will surely perish
of cold if nothing else,” he said finally. “The night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
will soon come and none can find him before morning.”</p>

<p>That settled it. By morning, Kutnar would be
well on his way and among the mountains; then he
need worry no more about the Muskman, be he dead
or alive.</p>

<p>He left his fallen enemy lying among the bushes,
took one more longing look at the broad eastern
path and then fled rapidly in the southern direction
along the line of the River Pas.</p>

<h2>XXI</h2>

<p>Gonch was not dead although a few moments
more of Kutnar’s throttling grip
would have made him so beyond question.
Some men are hard to kill. Gonch was of
that kind. Even as he lay, to all appearances, stiff
and stark, the life-blaze flickered feebly, gathered
fresh strength and flared up. His chest heaved, he
uttered a deep sigh, then groaned and opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>For a moment he was dazed by the position in
which he found himself. He lay sprawling in the
snow among the bushes, staring at the sky. Far in
the distance, he could see the peak of Castillo. The
sun setting behind the mountain-top, crowned it
with a rubescent halo. The day was nearing its
close.</p>

<p>Gonch gnashed his teeth with terrible rage as he
remembered why it was he lay there. He, warrior
and second man of the Castillan tribe, had been
bested by a boy. His humiliation was beyond
power to describe. His hate and fury were even
worse. He would have given his last drop of life-blood
for a chance to grapple again with Kutnar
but this opportunity was denied him, for the lad
was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;" id="illus19">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">“Gonch Recovered by Degrees”</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Gonch recovered by degrees. He lifted his head
and shoulders, supporting himself in a couchant
position upon his elbows. There he rested for a
time gathering renewed vigor from the fresh air
with which he now filled his lungs. He raised himself
to a sitting position. The wind sweeping down
upon him from the northeast was biting cold. He
shivered. “I will surely die if I stay here much
longer,” he thought as he observed the sky’s fading
light. He must get back to Castillo somehow and
it must be done soon, before sundown. The cave-men
might find him, true enough but not before
morning. By that time he would be frozen solid
and past mentioning. He could almost feel the
rending teeth as his mates ripped the flesh from his
bones. “Not that—not that!” he whined in an
agony of terror. The fear of being eaten gave him
strength. He grit his teeth in desperation and
was soon crawling through the snow on his hands
and knees toward the distant mountain.</p>

<p>It was black dark and the cave-men were snoring
out their sleep when the night fire watcher heard
cries coming from far down the mountain side. He
listened and recognized them as those of a human
being, so he went down and found the Muskman
crawling upward his laborious way. With the
man’s aid, Gonch was brought to the top where he
fell exhausted beside the fire. This aroused some
of the sleepers and they issued from the cave-entrance
to learn what was the matter. At sight of
their distressed comrade, they made so much ado<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
that soon the whole tribe was wide awake and stirring.
The giant hetman came forth and prodded
Gonch with his foot. “You are late,” he grumbled
and then looked all about him. “Where is the boy?
He went with you. Where is he now?”</p>

<p>“Gone,” the Muskman moaned feebly.</p>

<p>“Gone?” Totan observed his henchman’s torn
throat. He howled vindictively as the truth
dawned upon him. “And your ax; it too seems to
have disappeared. Did boy and ax go together?”</p>

<p>It was in Gonch’s mind to tell a falsehood ascribing
his condition to the fury of some fierce beast,
but he was too exhausted to think of aught but Kutnar’s
escape and the necessity for immediate pursuit.
“Yes,” he groaned. “The boy struck me
down and escaped. He must be followed and
brought back.”</p>

<p>The hetman scowled and grinned with cruel malice.
“In good time,” he sneered. “He who allows
himself to be mauled by a boy, may not give commands.
We are not bats to fly around in the darkness
and bump our heads to no purpose. The boy
will not have gone far. At the first sign of light,
we will feast and be on our way to find him.”</p>

<p>“Feast?” inquired one of the men. “On what?”</p>

<p>“This,” replied the hetman digging his toes into
Gonch’s ribs. “He promised to bring us the Mammoth
Man and failed. He has lost us our most
expert hunter. Empty boasts are fit only to fill
empty stomachs. Tell me, hungry men, what is the
penalty?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“Death,” growled a voice.</p>

<p>“Death,” echoed from four-score pairs of lungs,
and there ensued a great rattling of clubs. The
hetman stilled the tumult with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” he protested good-naturedly. “The
poltroon is all but dead now. In the morning, I
will give you a rare treat—fresh meat with the blood
still dripping from it. We will roast him alive.”</p>

<p>Gonch heard and sickened with deadly fear, but
he retained wit enough to lie quiet and appear as
dead as possible. Totan rolled him over with his
foot and peered into his face. The face was that of
a corpse. It looked as though the hetman’s little
joke would be spoiled long before sunrise. He
left the body lying there and returned to the cave-entrance.
The others followed and soon all were
settled down and asleep once more. Apparently
Gonch’s lucky star had set for the last time, then
something happened to send it soaring to the zenith
with renewed brilliancy.</p>

<p>One man remained by the fire as a sentinel to
watch and feed the blaze. Had the Muskman made
an effort to escape, this man if wide awake would
have noticed it and given the alarm. However, he
fell asleep after a time as was evidenced by his attitude
and the sound of his loud breathing.</p>

<p>Gonch may have been more dead than alive, but
the fear of what morning meant for him was the best
tonic in the world for his ailment. Almost imperceptibly
inch by inch he shifted his body away from
the fire to the coping of the ledge and lowered himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
noiselessly down. Once out of sight of wakeful
eyes, he crept around the mountain beyond hearing
distance of Castillo and climbed upward. No
one would expect him to venture in that direction;
therefore he chose to perform the unexpected. Up,
up he crawled through the darkness, regardless of
the pain and weariness his efforts cost him. Time
was precious, for the fire-tender might awake at
any moment and give the alarm.</p>

<p>Gonch reached the mountain crest and lay gasping
amid piles of rubble and jagged boulders.
There were plenty of places to hide and as he was
nigh fainting with exhaustion, he chose the remotest
recess available and secured himself snugly within
it. In a few moments he was sound asleep.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<h2>XXII</h2>

<p>After disposing of Gonch, Kutnar fled as
fast as he could along the Pas. Near the
west shore of the river, the ice would bear
his weight and so he kept to that in preference
to the high bank where his footprints in the
snow might be plainly seen. The ice left little or
no trail.</p>

<p>He had beaten the Muskman in a fair hand-to-hand
combat. The whole pack would soon be after
him and yet he felt not at all afraid. Rather his
sensations were those of buoyant self-reliance. He
had vanquished a full-grown and seasoned warrior;
something of an accomplishment for a sixteen year
old lad. Such a feat gave him confidence in himself.
Kutnar was not yet fully trained to the flint-ax;
the sling was his weapon. A stern chase would
afford him plenty of chance to use it. He had slain
the young Castillan throwing champion with it and
might repeat the performance if pressed too closely.</p>

<p>He was free. “Why did I not think to run away
before?” he wondered, not realizing that a marked
change had come over him and made him in many
respects a man.</p>

<p>All this time he was hurrying southward along
the Pas. The mountain of Castillo still hovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
upon his right flank. He ran abreast of its southern
exposure and had turned his head as though to
look upon it for the last time before he sped onward,
when he caught sight of a dark spot high upon its
side. The spot was a cave.</p>

<p>Kutnar stopped and gazed thoughtfully at this
cave. It was but a short distance from Castillo and
on the same mountain. Its proximity to the stronghold
of his enemies was what made him view it with
such interest. Who would think of looking for him
there? Surely not Totan and his band. They
would expect the runaway to flee from them much
farther than that. What a lark! His enemies
would search far and wide while he whom they
sought lay hidden almost within sight of their own
haunt. Then, too, he was jaded and needed rest.
His previous night had been spent fire-tending and
he had passed a strenuous day. All of these considerations
tempted him. He left the river and turned
to the distant slope treading only on bare ground
and stones where possible, so as to leave no snow-tracks.
After a long hard climb, he reached his
goal and found only a bitter disappointment awaiting
him. It was not a real cave but a grotto or shallow
nook scooped from the rock. He could see
every inch of the interior as he stood at the entrance
but no living thing was there. As a hiding place, it
had no possibilities. Kutnar now observed a hole in
its floor. “A fox’s den,” he thought. “I am glad
that the place is of use to someone.” He kneeled
over the hole and peered in. A draught of air blew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in his face. He coughed and the sound was
repeated in a distant echo. This was both surprising
and interesting. The hole was barely large
enough to admit his body but there might be a larger
cavity beneath. Not a fox’s den nor the home of
any animal; he learned this by sniffing carefully
about the cavity. Where did it lead? He put his
feet in the hole and slid half-way in. It was a tube
of solid rock. He could feel its sides with his toes
but no bottom. He lowered himself further until
head and all were in and still he found no place to
set his feet. He let himself down another yard and
it was just the same. “There must be an end sometime,”
he thought as he continued to work his way
downward. The descent was a simple matter, for
the tube now jogged slightly this way and that,
making it easy for him to cling to its sides with his
hands and feet. The air was warmer than that outside;
although humid and musty, it could be
breathed.</p>

<p>The tube began to widen. The slight noise made
by his feet sliding over the rock, sounded loud and
distinct. The passage gradually angled more to
the horizontal. It widened still more and the boy
was able to turn and glance behind him. All was
dark but in some places the shadows were darker
than others. Kutnar heard squeaks and the flapping
of bat wings. Evidently the passage-way
opened into a large room.</p>

<p>By this time, Kutnar felt keenly elated over his
discovery. As a hiding place, the grotto offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
great possibilities after all; not the grotto itself but
the subterranean vault whose only means of access
was the stone tube. The casual observer who could
see every corner of the shallow cave, would not think
of looking for a cavity beneath. Kutnar decided to
stay in the vault for a time to hide and rest. There
was the hole in the floor of the grotto however and
it would be well to conceal that or someone might
learn of the underground room as he had done. He
crawled back through the tube the way he had come
and stood once more in the open air.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark; the deep twilight preceding
dusk, for night had settled over the mountain
while Kutnar was exploring the cavity and where it
led. There were many rocks piled below the cave-threshold
and he hunted about until he found one
of the right shape and size. He tried this over the
vent and it fitted nicely, effectively concealing the
opening in the floor. Anyone standing at the
threshold would now gaze upon a bare interior; bare
of aught but a single stone.</p>

<p>“Ha-a-a, yum!” Kutnar yawned loudly and
stretched his limbs. Now that the day’s excitement
was over and he had time for relaxation, a wave of
drowsiness swept over him. He would sleep in the
grotto, trusting to his sixth or slumber guarding
sense to warn him of imminent danger. As a last
resort, he could lower his body into the tube, set the
stone above his head and hide as long as he pleased
in the vault beneath.</p>

<p>He was preparing to lie down upon the floor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the grotto when he heard something that brought
him to his feet in quick time. He tiptoed to the
threshold and saw a dark figure ascending the slope.
The figure was coming toward him. It moved in
an erect position but it seemed too large and clumsy
to be a man. It came nearer and although but an
ebon patch on a sable background, Kutnar recognized
it as a bear and a large one. What brought
the creature there? Either the grotto was its permanent
home or it was seeking merely a night’s
lodging. Kutnar could not now safely vacate the
premises, even had he chosen to do so. He tiptoed
back to the grotto and moved the stone aside from
the cavity, then lowered his body down, holding
the stone in both hands high above his head as he
descended. Arms and hands sank from sight and
the stone settled over the hole. To all appearances,
the grotto was now vacant.</p>

<p>Kutnar continued his downward journey until
he reached the large room. Here he sat listening
but could hear no sounds to indicate what might be
transpiring above. Had the bear come and gone
or was he now lying upon the floor of the grotto
making ready to sleep? Kutnar thought it unnecessary
for him to go up and find out. There was
his own night’s rest to consider, so he lay down and
pillowed his head upon his arm. He fell asleep
without knowing when but awoke sooner than he
would have wished because of the damp mustiness
which oppressed his lungs. Fresh air, that was
what he wanted, so he sought the passage-way and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
wriggled through it as noiselessly as a snake. On
arriving at the top, he sought and found the stone
and thrust it aside, inch by inch. After staying
there for some time with his face as close to the
opening as he dared, refreshing himself with deep
breaths of outside air, he reset the stone and returned
to finish his nap. He repeated this performance
several times, not without considerable
risk, for the bear was asleep in the cave-entrance
as he knew from the sound of its breathing. “Even
a cave-beast and a man can get along together
sleeping in the same den,” he chuckled as he made
his fourth upward trip. As he neared the outlet
of the tube, he saw faint rays of light and knew
that morning was near at hand. When he had
moved the stone partly aside, he set his ear at the
opening but heard no sounds. It would seem that
his visitor had awakened and taken his leave. However,
there was only one way to be sure of this.
That was to see it with his own eyes. Slowly,
noiselessly he shifted the stone farther and farther
away until the opening was entirely clear, then his
head arose almost imperceptibly through the tube
and above the level of the cave-floor, giving him a
view of the entrance and the grey world beyond.</p>

<h2>XXIII</h2>

<p>The valley of the Ebro may have been perfectly
satisfactory to the Mammoth and
Rhinoceros but as regards climate, it did not
suit Pic, for he possessed no hide garment to
cover his nakedness. Winter was in full swing and
the cold wind so chilled his body that he was driven
to descend from the Mammoth’s neck and walk to
keep warm. Pic was not a fast walker and the
snowdrifts made it worse. It was an unfortunate
situation for it reduced very considerably the distance
which the trio might have traveled in a day.
Then more snow fell and the drifts became so deep
that Pic could scarcely make any progress at all.
It was not surprising that he tired rapidly and was
soon compelled to remount the Mammoth’s neck.
This rested him and enabled the party to proceed at
a fast gait but it was not long before the cold wind
whistling about his ears, drove him to the ground
again. There, as before, he floundered through the
drifts and soon exhausted himself. All the time, he
scolded and fretted because he and his associates
were not making more progress. Hairi and Wulli
considered his irritation uncalled for. It was his
fault not theirs that they failed to do better. “You
ought to grow more hair,” grumbled the Mammoth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and this made Pic so peevish, he would not speak
to his friends for a time. The two animals in their
turn, now became moody and irritable. Taken altogether
they and Pic were not getting along very
well and felt all the more vexed with each other for
that very reason.</p>

<p>Then came a gale sweeping down upon them
from the west to make matters worse. The wind
blew clouds of fine snow-dust into their faces, lodging
and accumulating there until the Mammoth and
Rhinoceros were disguised in great white masks.
This did not bother them in the least. Having no
vanity as to their personal appearance and being
warmly clad, they felt quite cozy and comfortable.</p>

<p>Pic’s case was different. The storm multiplied
his worry and discomfort. The wind numbed his
body. He was almost smothered and blinded by
the fine sleet which drove into his mouth and eyes.
Once more he slid down from the Mammoth’s neck
and labored forward on foot. Finally he stopped.
“I can go no farther,” he said. “Without warmth
and rest, I will die. I fear that you must leave me.”</p>

<p>Both animals halted. The situation had grown
acute. “Die? Leave you?” said the Mammoth.
“We will wait while you warm and rest yourself.”</p>

<p>Pic made a wry face. “More easily said than
done. Even a hare would find no shelter here.”</p>

<p>“But the mountains,” Hairi suggested. “There
must be a hole in them somewhere.”</p>

<p>Up to this time, the party had seen no caves. Pic
would have spent every night in one, were there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
caves to be had. So far he had not noticed one;
and many miles had by this time been traveled along
the southern flank of the Cantabrian range. Hairi
was right. Lucky for Pic, his good-fortune had
not entirely deserted him, for as he looked toward
the mountain through the blinding snow-dust, he
saw a dark spot high upon its side. One glimpse
was enough; the dark spot was a cave and he joyfully
made known the news to his companions.</p>

<p>All smiled once more. It was agreed that their
onward march would be halted temporarily, giving
Pic a chance to take refuge in the cave and rest until
the storm was over. Meanwhile, the two animals
would wait in the lee of a rock-shelter which could
be seen a half mile or so beyond the cave. When
the weather cleared, Pic would rejoin his friends
and they would continue as before. With this understanding,
they separated. Pic made for the
mountain side, while Hairi and Wulli moved off
toward the rock-shelter.</p>

<p>Pic climbed up to the cave, but before intruding
he made a careful preliminary inspection. Possession
was nine points of law in such cases; the tenth
point was getting possession. “Cave-jumping”
was an offense meriting capital punishment. There
could be no mercy shown one who attempted to
deprive another of his home. This applied to men’s
dealings with beasts as well as with each other. Men
and beasts both fancied the same sort of dwelling,
and in the winter time particularly there was constant
rivalry between them for the possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
desirable caves. Some were more desirable than
others, being furnished with more than one entrance
or having advantages of plumbing and ventilation;
such as cool drinking water trickling through the
ceiling, or openings in the roof to permit the escape
of smoke and foul air. Most of them had thresholds
or sun-rooms, where the tenant might loll outside
and enjoy natural light and warmth. Neither man
nor flesh-eating beasts knew how to build houses,
and so they made use of the best that Nature gave
them.</p>

<p>Pic knew he had no business in that cave if some
one were already there, but his needs were great
and he intended to occupy it no matter who disputed
him. He stepped boldly within.</p>

<p>Although vacant, the place did not lack an owner.
It bore a pungent animal odor and that odor was
fairly fresh. The occupant had been there recently
and gone away. “Probably I will have gone away,
too, by the time he returns,” thought Pic. The
storm was already abating and it would not be long
before he could resume his journey. Before selecting
a comfortable spot to lie down and rest, he set
about to learn what variety of animal he might have
to deal with, should it return. His nose informed
him that the odor was not that of a lion or any other
cat-like animal. That was good, for they were his
most formidable enemies. Wolf or hyena? No;
then it must be a bear. Yes, it was a bear! Now
his anxiety was relieved. Such animals varied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
greatly in size and fierceness, but most of them were
comparatively harmless if let alone.</p>

<p>Pic lay down in the cave-entrance where wind
and sleet could not reach him and laughed at the
storm outside. He could see the broad snow-covered
expanse of country below him. The Mammoth
and Rhinoceros had disappeared. A large boulder
hung at the verge of the cave-threshold and obstructed
his view in that direction. It also prevented
his seeing what might be coming toward him up the
mountain side. Not until he heard the crunch,
crunch of something breaking through the snow-crust,
did he realize that he was about to have a
visitor. He sprang to his feet, glided to the boulder
and peered over, then dropped behind it again for
fear of being observed.</p>

<p>A burly animal was ascending to the cave. It
was heavily furred and round like a big ball. A
bear; Pic had interpreted the odor rightly, but he
had not bargained for one as large as this. It was
neither the black nor brown species, but a huge
brute that no man, however strong and brave, would
care to meddle with—the giant Cave Bear.</p>

<p>The beast came lumbering up the steep mountain
side, occasionally stopping to gaze westward.
At such times it growled. Probably it had seen
the Mammoth and Rhinoceros pass by and decided
that its den needed watching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">“The Cave Bear Looked Up and Growled”</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Pic gripped his ax tightly, for he knew this was
an occasion to try any bear’s temper. The one
coming toward him appeared big enough to do
anything. He would put up a good fight without
question, in the defense of his home. The man
looked at his ax-blade and shook his head. Even
its keen edge would find difficulty in reaching a
vital spot through that heavy fur. One blow, possibly
two, were all he could expect to deliver
before the huge beast would close in. Once those
mighty paws were around his body it would go
hard with him.</p>

<p>The beast halted directly beneath the boulder
behind which the man lay hidden. Should anything
disturb that boulder and cause it to fall, so much
the worse for Mr. Bear. Pic braced his feet
against the projections of the ledge surface behind
him and set his shoulders against the stone. One
mighty heave loosened it from its setting. The
Cave Bear looked up and growled. The motion of
the stone and the slight noise above aroused his
suspicions. Pic put forth every ounce of his great
strength in a second effort. The boulder swayed,
then toppled over. The beast saw it coming and
made a frantic attempt to save himself. Too late!
The huge stone descended upon him with a crash
and the two went rolling and tumbling together
down the mountain side, with Pic bounding after
them, ax in hand, to deal the finishing blow.</p>

<p>But there was no need to complete the damage
that the stone had begun. When Pic arrived at the
foot of the declivity he found a perfectly dead bear.
The crushing weight of the boulder and the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
battering journey down the steep incline had made
an end of the beast for all time.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent animal, bulging with winter
fat and the finest of heavy fur. Pic looked down
upon it and sighed. Bears in general interested
him and appealed to his gentler nature; bluff and
ungainly and so different from skulking flesh-eaters.
The beast had died without a chance to
defend himself. Pic’s triumph was tinged with
profound regret; but one or the other of them had
to die, he consoled himself, and he preferred the
bear to be that one. He marvelled at the beast’s
vast proportions; its thick hams and mighty paws;
then his attention was drawn to the fur. “A wonderful
coat,” he said, as he kneeled and ran his
fingers through it. “Would that I had one like it
to keep out the cold.”</p>

<p>“It is yours; take it,” something within him
answered and the idea once born, soon became a
reality. In a trice, his ax-blade was unbound from
its wooden handle and became a knife. With this,
Pic began to skin the beast, a tremendous task for
a lone man with nothing but a flint tool to aid him.
But the flint was sharp and the man’s strength and
determination carried him through. He slit the
neck, chest and belly downward, then the forepaws,
and after much cutting and tugging pulled the
complete hide from the carcass. The hind legs
were uncovered without slitting, leaving those
parts of the skin solid like a pair of boots. When
the hide was completely detached inside out, Pic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
turned it back the right way again and the job
was done.</p>

<p>He remounted his ax-head, rested and refreshed
himself with some flesh-strips from the carcass,
then proceeded to have a try-on of his new one-piece
suit. The hind legs made comfortable trousers,
and the rest of it, although somewhat loose and
badly hung, might have been much worse. No
better garment could have been devised to keep out
the cold, and that was the main idea. It had but
one drawback. Pic found it a most unwieldy thing
to navigate in. When he tried to walk, he did
nothing but trip and stumble over his own feet.
This was no more than amusing, for he was feeling
warm and comfortable and ready to smile at anything.
“Hairi and Wulli will be surprised when
they see me in this,” he laughed. “Agh! What a
relief! My coat is every bit as warm as theirs.
Snow, ice, cold wind; what of them? Now our way
may lead to the country of the Mammoth and Rhinoceros,
for all I care.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<h2>XXIV</h2>

<p>The Mammoth and Rhinoceros were standing
near the foot of the mountain beneath
an overhanging cliff. From time to time
they glanced eastward as though expecting
some one. The storm had moderated considerably.</p>

<p>“It’s about time he were returning,” Hairi remarked.
“I hope when he does come back he will
be all rested and warm. What a pity he cannot
learn to fancy the cold weather as we do.”</p>

<p>“Here he comes now,” said the Rhinoceros.</p>

<p>Both animals possessed keen ears and noses, but
their eyesight was not at all good. They saw a
blurred figure coming toward them through the
snow, but neither one of them could have distinguished
a man from an elk at that distance. The
figure moved in a most peculiar manner. It walked
on its hind legs, but as it approached them the two
friends saw, to their astonishment, that it was not
a man.</p>

<p>“A bear,” muttered Wulli.</p>

<p>“Yes, it looks like a bear,” said the Mammoth;
“but did you ever see one behave like that?”</p>

<p>The creature was in truth performing most
strangely. Its movements were those of one intoxicated,
a condition that neither of the pair had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
ever observed in a bear or any one else, for that
matter. It seemed to be having great difficulty
managing its legs and feet. These tripped over
and interfered with one another in an astonishing
way. The big body heaved and tossed about because
of its unreliable support. Finally, when several
rods distant, it stumbled and fell sprawling in
the snow. Hairi and Wulli looked on in amazement
as the creature floundered helplessly upon its
back like a turtle. After much puffing and grunting,
it righted itself and again assumed an upright
position.</p>

<p>A bear was nothing to be afraid of; so thought
the Mammoth and Rhinoceros; but this one’s behavior
mystified them. Once on its feet again, it
lurched and lumbered forward, waving both paws
as if in greeting. “Hi-yo, Hairi! Hi-yo, Wulli!”
it cried.</p>

<p>The two friends jumped. They were trembling
now and too scared to move. The words and voice
sounded strangely familiar. They were those of a
human being, but the creature was a bear. Then
more surprising still, its head fell back and a man’s
face appeared. The mouth was grinning as though
it would split.</p>

<p>The Mammoth was on the point of beating a
hasty retreat when Wulli suddenly squealed, “Pic!
that is his face. What has become of the rest of
him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus21">
<img src="images/illus21.jpg" width="650" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Pic Astonishes His Friends</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Hairi’s eyes opened wide. “Pic, sure enough.
But his body; where is that? The bear must have
eaten it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he ate the bear,” whispered Wulli,
clutching at a small ray of hope. “Let’s ask him.”</p>

<p>“Ho-ho!” laughed the unknown. “Did I
frighten you? Now don’t run away, Hairi, for
there is nothing to worry about. Nobody has eaten
anybody.”</p>

<p>The voice was reassuring and it belonged to Pic
without question. The Mammoth breathed more
freely. He advanced a few steps and touched the
other with the tip of his trunk. “Fur, long and
thick like a bear’s.” He turned to the Rhinoceros
and said, “I told him to do it and he has done it.
But who would believe that he could grow so much
hair and in so short a time?”</p>

<p>Sounds of muffled laughter greeted this last remark.
Wulli now came forward to investigate the
reason for this unseemly mirth. He sniffed at the
bearskin, then suddenly backed away squealing
with alarm. “Oo-wee! Blood! I smell it! Oo-wee;
somebody has been killed.”</p>

<p>The two animals might have bolted then and
there, had not Pic put an end to the farce. He
threw the skin from his body and it fell in a heap
about his legs.</p>

<p>“It is I; all of me,” he said. “Somebody has been
killed but I was not the one. I slew the bear, otherwise
he would have slain me. With my flint-blade
I cut his pelt from him and now it is mine.”</p>

<p>“And so you did not grow it,” said the Mammoth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
somewhat crestfallen. “At any rate, you
did your best to do as I told you.”</p>

<p>Wulli took an entirely different view of the matter.
He could appreciate a good fighter. “Only
a big man could kill such a big bear,” he remarked
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“And a smaller bear would not have been much
use to him,” Hairi sagely remarked. “He could
never have gotten in its skin. I say he did right.”</p>

<p>“Right or wrong, only a good fighter could have
done it,” grumbled the Rhinoceros.</p>

<p>“And now I am clad as warmly as you are,” said
Pic. “It will be better for all of us, for we can
travel as fast as we please. The skin will keep me
warm. This makes us three instead of two Tundr-folk.”</p>

<p>The new arrangement was a success from the
very start. The bearskin had its drawbacks, but
they detracted only in a small measure from the
main point. Pic could not make much headway in
it traveling on foot; furthermore, the Mammoth
was obliged to lift him to his seat when he vainly
endeavored to mount. Pic was no more able to
help himself than a turkey tied up in brown paper.
However, when once astride Hairi’s neck, he was
in the height of his glory. His new garment was
impervious to wind and cold, and having nothing to
do but sit and think, he felt thoroughly comfortable
and contented. The two animals shared his good
spirits. From then on the party got along finely
and proceeded at a great rate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ebro River soon appeared upon their left.
It was fed by many smaller streams flowing into it
from the mountains. The latter were frequently
cleft by deep passes or defiles running through
them from south to north. After crossing the
headwaters of the Ebro the trio came in sight of
another mountain pass traversed by a modest
stream. This latter was partly frozen over, but
the Mammoth and Rhinoceros were powerful cold-water
swimmers and found little trouble in breaking
their way through the ice to the opposite side.
As they climbed the bank and halted to shake the
water out of their shaggy coats, Pic saw before
him a lofty peak in whose side, five hundred feet or
more above the level on which he stood, loomed a
dark spot. His trained eye immediately recognized
it as a cave. It must be in or near the zone
of human occupancy if what the snow-grouse had
said was true. Now was the time to cut through
the mountain range to the northern side.</p>

<p>Pic glanced at the sky. The sun was hidden in
the west. Before long, all would be dark. The
party must wait until morning before proceeding,
and so they began to look about for a convenient
spot to halt and rest. Pic resolved to spend his
night in the cave, assuming it to be vacant. No
fire burned upon its threshold. And yet, it might
be the home of a man who could be forced to give
information that might prove valuable.</p>

<p>The trio advanced to the mountain. It appeared
near, but appearances were deceiving, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
it was quite dark when they drew up at the foot of
the steep slope. Here Pic and his friends parted;
the former to climb upward, the latter to proceed
a short distance, browsing as they went.</p>

<p>Pic discovered the cave to be a small one and
unoccupied. However, it had been a man’s home
and probably still was, for the human odor still
clung to it. This was interesting and important,
for it was reasonable to suppose that other human
beings lived somewhere near. Pic glowed all over
with the pleasure and excitement this thought
aroused in him. The long climb too had warmed
him, particularly as he was now attired in his bearskin
suit. The latter was cumbersome, but it
would make a comfortable sleeping bag, and for
that reason he had been loth to leave it behind.
Before settling down upon the threshold to rest he
examined the cave. There was little to see, for it
was a small and simple hollow in the rock and absolutely
bare except for a single flat stone lying
upon the floor. Pic lay down in the cave-entrance,
gathered his robe about him and was not long in
drifting to the land of rest and forgetfulness.</p>

<p>In the morning’s small hours he suddenly awakened.
A low scraping noise sounded from behind
him—from the floor of the cave. It continued with
fits and starts. Still lying motionless, he turned his
head around far enough to view the cave interior.
He saw nothing there—nothing but the stone upon
the floor. “Probably some small animal stirring,”
he thought and then—the stone moved. For a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
moment he was startled, to say the least. No stone
ever shifted about of itself. Something must be
pushing it. He looked on dumbfounded as the
stone hitched itself almost imperceptibly along the
cave-floor. It appeared bewitched; and then, as
he watched its strange motions while uneasiness
and fear of the unknown began to creep over him,
a vent appeared beneath the stone and from it
issued a human hand.</p>

<p>A man! The mystery was now explained.</p>

<p>The cave-owner was concealed in a hole in the
floor and was removing the stone which covered
the entrance to it. Pic gathered his feet together
under him, laughing softly to himself. What was
there to fear from one man? He rose to a crouching
position, relieving himself of the bearskin as he
did so. Leaving this in a heap where he had lain,
he crawled to the rear of the grotto and kneeled
behind the hole in the floor, his arms outstretched—and
waiting. The mysterious hands—there were
now two of them—sank within the cavity and a
head appeared. It rose until its eyes were above
the level of the cave-floor. The eyes stared at the
bearskin robe a few seconds, then the head settled
down and again the hands reached upward to grasp
the stone.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">“The Unknown Was Plucked From His Burrow”</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Quick as lightning Pic pounced upon the hands,
locking both wrists in his iron grip. One heave
and the unknown was plucked from his burrow
like a rabbit, struggling and yelling like fury at
finding himself so suddenly caught. A boy and a
stout one, too, for he fought like a wildcat; but he
was as helpless as a kitten in the clutches of the
giant Mousterian. Pic held him fast and dragged
him to the outside light. “Agh, little rascal!” he
said. “And so you were the one who disturbed
my night’s rest.”</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice, the boy gave a loud cry
that made his captor’s heart leap within his chest:</p>

<p>“Father!”</p>

<p>Pic seized the lad’s head between his hands and
turned it so that he could peer into the face. His
knees trembled, his whole body shook as with ague.</p>

<p>“Kutnar! Boy, is it you?”</p>

<p>For an instant each face stared at the other as
in the waking moments of a dream. Then came
light and understanding and in a moment father
and son were locked tightly in each other’s arms.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<h2>XXV</h2>

<p>The sky might have fallen in just then;
anything might have happened and Pic
would not have noticed it. He had no
thought of aught but the one happiness
that filled his heart to bursting—Kutnar was
found. The pursuit through southwestern France,
the long journey across the Pyrenees, the terrible
cold; all were set aside and forgotten for this supreme
moment—one of the most blissful he had
ever known. For a time, nothing was said. Father
and son sat in the cave-entrance, holding each other
tightly as though they would never let go. Kutnar
wept silent tears. He had played the part of a
man well, but once more under the protection of
his powerful sire, the reaction was overwhelming
and he was but a baby boy, tired and homesick and
so glad to be again with the one he loved best.</p>

<p>When the first joy of meeting was over, Pic
drifted back to earth. “What were you doing in
that hole?” he asked.</p>

<p>Kutnar told of his escape from Castillo and the
various events leading to it. Everything bespoke
the Muskman’s perfidy and cruelty. Pic’s face
became adamant as the tale of Gonch’s duplicity
gradually unfolded itself. Driven to desperation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the boy had turned upon the traitor, who must have
by this time breathed his last.</p>

<p>“I could tell you more,” said Pic, “but what you
already know is enough. However, it would seem
that what my boy has suffered has made him bear
himself as well or better than a man. And this
Gonch; are you quite sure he is dead?”</p>

<p>To this Kutnar replied: “No, I do not feel at
all sure. When I left him lying in the bushes he
still breathed. Something warned me to make an
end of the ruffian, but I could not summon courage
to deal the death-stroke.”</p>

<p>Pic fidgeted uneasily. “It would have been
wiser had you shown him no mercy,” he said; “but
you did well and I am proud of you. Now I am
going to treat you to a pleasant surprise. You
see, I did not come alone. The Mammoth and
Rhinoceros are near at hand and waiting for us
to meet them.”</p>

<p>While saying this, he was on his feet striding to
the edge of the cave-threshold with Kutnar by his
side. Suddenly he uttered an imprecation and
withdrew hastily into the grotto, dragging the boy
with him. “Your enemies! I had forgotten them,”
he said. “Agh; let us hope they have not seen us.”</p>

<p>Vain hope; he had jumped back quickly, but too
late. Several groups of men stood apart from each
other at the foot of the eastern and southern declivities.
They were waving their clubs and pointing
upward to the cave. As Pic endeavored to conceal
himself, a chorus of howls floated to his ears and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
he saw human figures scrambling up the steep
ascent. For an instant he stood irresolute. If
fight he must, he could not choose a better position
than the one he now held. He was but one against
many; how many? He gazed down at his enemies;
here, there and everywhere. They seemed to be
coming in swarms. He was a giant, past master
with the flint-ax, but there were limits as to what
one man could do. A sudden change came over
him. His eyes blazed death. He bared his teeth
and his features became those of a gorilla, tracked
to his lair by the hunters and brought to bay. He
beat his great chest with one clenched hand, while
with the other he shook his ax at the men below
him. He howled furiously. Four-score throats
gave answer. The several groups of men had by
this time spread out and joined each other in a
long, thin line. Single figures were hastening toward
the western slope to extend that line. They
moved fast. The path westward was still open;
soon it would be closed. There at the far end of it
awaited the Mammoth and Rhinoceros. Pic was
but one man pitting himself against a host. Even
in his fury, he saw the better part of wisdom.</p>

<p>“Quick, run!” he cried, pointing to the west.
“Once with our friends, we can laugh at any number
of these wretches.” So away they scurried
along the mountain side, while their pursuers, observing
them, hastened around in the same direction
to cut them off.</p>

<p>Hairi and Wulli were standing motionless on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the western side of the mountain and to the north.
They heard shouts and cries and saw two men running
toward them along the heights. While they
were wondering why there should be two instead
of one, more men appeared, a crowd of them, also
coming head on, but from farther down. What
did it all mean? It would seem that the two were
being set upon by many. If so, one of the fugitives
must be Pic. Although uneasy and not knowing
just what to expect, they kept close watch and
waited until the time came to take some action.</p>

<p>So engrossed were they in the two men and their
pursuers, they had no eyes for something far above
their heads. The mountain at whose base they
stood, ascended gradually to the Scarp—a precipitous
rock-wall whose craggy pinnacles were lost
above the morning brume. Apparently none but
birds or the Chamois and Ibex among beasts could
have found a footing upon its glabrous surface.
But there crouched a man. None knew of his
presence except himself. In the grey dawn he had
crawled part way down the wall to hide where none
dared come; none but one unusually sure-footed
and possessed of a clear head. The man was
Gonch.</p>

<p>He had journeyed by the early morning light
from the northern side of the mountain where lived
the cave-men of Castillo. A night’s rest and realization
that he was still alive, had given him renewed
strength and courage. He had been so bold
as to creep half-way down the Scarp, where even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
on the smooth rock, occasional rugged projections
and crevices gave him a chance to hold tightly on.
He had paused to rest temporarily before descending
further to where the wall leaned outward,
forming a canopy or shelter over a ledge at the
base of the Scarp. While resting and wondering
what the day had in store for him, suddenly he
espied two large animals standing motionless far
down the mountain slope beneath him. He recognized
them as the Mammoth and Woolly Rhinoceros.
His face blanched. “How did they come
there?” he muttered, gazing far and wide over the
country below him. At that moment he heard distant
cries and two human figures hove in sight.
They were running swiftly toward him from the
south and along the mountain side. More figures
followed, many of them coming from farther down
the slopes.</p>

<p>As the two figures drew nearer he recognized
one of them, who led by several yards. The other
who followed was a much larger man—a giant of
herculean build. Gonch grasped the whole situation—at
least he thought he did. Kutnar had been
overtaken and was now being hotly pursued by the
Castillan horde. The larger of the two men—presumably
Totan—was on the verge of capturing the
youth. Gonch looked on, growing more and more
impatient as the latter drew nearer to his animal-friends.
What ailed the hetman? Why did he not
seize or strike down his quarry. “Agh, clumsy
dunce,” he muttered. “Soon you will be too late.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Strike, strike while you have the chance.” But the
supposed Totan kept on as before, following Kutnar
closely, but making no effort to kill or capture
him. “Pig, lubber,” thought the Muskman. “Your
folly will spoil everything. It is time for me to
take a hand and make an end of it.”</p>

<p>He looked about him. There were several
partly detached stone-blocks within his reach. He
chose the largest and pulled it loose. The rock
went bounding down the face of the Scarp. He
found another and another and tore them from the
wall. They in their descent dislodged other blocks
and the stream of them crashed and bounded down
upon the Mammoth and Rhinoceros. The latter
heard and saw the oncoming avalanche and immediately
flew into a panic. Squealing and bellowing
with fear, they turned tail and dashed away, with
the storm of rocks sweeping close behind them.</p>

<p>Gonch laughed wolfishly as he saw them go. He
had meant to destroy them, and although this plan
failed, there was some satisfaction in knowing that
the next best thing was accomplished. Kutnar now
need expect no assistance from his friends. The
man and boy slowed up as the storm of rocks swept
down the mountain side. They saw the two beasts
gallop madly away. On the heights lay Pic’s only
chance for fighting off the man-pack. It was then
that he caught sight of the ledge and its protecting
canopy at the base of the Scarp.</p>

<p>“To the rock,” he panted, and Kutnar turned to
the right, with Pic after him. Gonch could now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
see the boy’s features; mouth open and nostrils
dilated with excitement and fatigue. It was then
that he also got a clear view of the man; the supposed
Totan. It was but a fleeting glimpse, for
the man and boy had already passed from his sight
beneath the shelter, but in those few moments he
learned his first mistake. It was not Totan but
the giant Mousterian weapon maker, the man
whom Gonch feared more than anything on earth.
Cold sweat exuded from every pore of the Muskman’s
body. His knees shook and he clutched the
rocks to save himself from falling. Then came the
reaction, as he saw the Castillan horde coming rapidly
toward him. Gonch wiped the cold dew from
his brow and laughed hideously. He was safe from
Pic’s wrath and soon he would be forever rid of his
most dreaded enemy. He descended the rock-wall
until he stood over the ledge where he could hear,
although not see, all of the tragedy about to be
enacted. From this elevated position he watched
the men of Castillo complete their enveloping
movement. All chance of the fugitives’ escape was
now gone. The cave-men came swarming up the
slope in a wide semi-circle, baying like hounds.
Gradually the wings of the line converged as those
on the two extreme ends rushed toward each other.
Those in the center drew closer together and moved
forward to meet the wings. Thus the human net
slowly contracted upon its prey—Kutnar the boy,
and Pic, hetman and weapon maker of the Mousterians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<h2>XXVI</h2>

<p>In the brief interval allotted him, Pic rested
and prepared himself for the impending
struggle. He had one thing to encourage
him; his position was admirably chosen. His
assailants must meet him face to face and climb up
to him. None could strike him from behind. He
took his place at the edge of the rock-platform and
hurled defiance at those who were advancing to destroy
him. To the men of Castillo, the powerful
figure and distorted features appeared as those of
some unearthly being. The thought that his new-found
cup of happiness might soon be snatched
from his lips, had nigh driven Pic to frenzy. He
was in truth a lion-man at bay, defending his cub.</p>

<p>Hiss! something whistled past. One of the on-rushing
horde reeled and fell. Pic turned and
saw the boy standing toe to the ledge-coping beside
him. Already the sling was reloaded and whirling
for a second cast. Hiss, again! Another man
dropped back, holding his arm and screaming like
a hurt beast. The stones flew fast, with few misses,
for there was little need of accurate shooting at
such a mass of men. Almost every shot left an
enemy accounted for. The cave-men wavered as
they witnessed the havoc wrought among them by
the deadly sling. They might have fled, but Totan
was there to drive on the laggards and strike down
any man who attempted to run away. Kutnar
strove to single him out, but one man was hard to
distinguish in the ruck and the hetman escaped
unscathed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>To Pic, his son’s prowess was a revelation.
Never was known such stone-throwing. “It is one
thing to hit a rabbit and another to hit a man coming
at you with a club,” he thought. “The boy is
a prodigy; may he live through this day.” The
men of Castillo were now closing in. Pic’s powerful
arm reached out and swept the lad behind him,
for the time was near at hand for closer work with
the flint-ax. “Well done,” he muttered. “My
turn now. Stand well back and give me plenty of
arm room to fight these wolves. Be ready with
your ax, for if I break or lose mine, I will need
another.”</p>

<p>Kutnar fell back obediently. His jaws were
clenched tightly together and the grip on his ax-handle
was even tighter as he awaited his chance
to help when most needed.</p>

<p>From his rock-roost, Gonch was an awed witness
of the boy’s deadly marksmanship. The sling
suddenly ceased its work, for now the cave-men
were coming to grips with those hidden from his
sight. He saw Totan detach himself from the
man-pack and fall back, permitting the yelling
horde to sweep past him. To the hetman’s credit
be it said that he who feared no man, now disdained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
casting the balance of his great strength into such
a one-sided contest. He stood with arms folded,
watching and shouting commands, but offering to
take no more active part where he considered himself
so little needed. Gonch observed Totan’s inaction.
The time had come when he might rid himself
of his two worst enemies at one fell stroke. He
leaned far out from the rock-wall and howled
furiously: “He has come as I promised. Up and
strike before another wins the glory. It is Pic, the
Lion Man himself.”</p>

<p>The giant hetman bristled as he heard. The
blood of the pit-fighter surged through his veins
like molten steel. In an instant his calm was
transformed into a tempest.</p>

<p>“The Lion Man?” he roared, tearing through
the crowd to the foot of the ledge. “And so he has
come to me at last. He is mine, I say, and my
hand alone shall do the butchering. Stand back,
every one of you. The man who raises a club to
strike him, dies.”</p>

<p>The cave-men stopped short, falling over one
another in their anxiety to keep out of the hetman’s
way. Totan turned from them to him who stood
upon the ledge. Pic had seen and heard all. He
shook his ax-blade defiantly in the other’s face.</p>

<p>“Butcher me?” he screamed. “You; ugly beast?
Come and try, here where there is room for both
of us.”</p>

<p>Totan answered with a thunderous roar. He
clambered up the ledge. Pic fell back several paces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
permitting his rival a foothold upon the rock-platform.
This gave the hetman a moment to prepare
himself—a bit of chivalry he failed to appreciate.
Men who gave ground or hesitated were afraid of
him—that was all. “Ar-r-r death!” he snarled like
a mad tiger and flung himself upon the Mousterian
champion.</p>

<p>“Death, so be it,” and Pic sprang forward to
meet him. So fierce was the onslaught that the two
giants came breast to breast before either had a
chance to strike. Quick as a cat, Pic dropped his
ax and grappled with his burly opponent, throwing
both arms about him, bear-fashion. Finding himself
at a disadvantage, Totan too let fall his
weapon, roaring with rage and pain and fighting
like a demon to break the other’s crushing grip.</p>

<p>But Pic had the under hold. With arms clamped
around his rival’s midriff, and face beneath the
hetman’s chin beyond the reach of tearing fingers
and snapping bull-teeth, he held him as in an iron
vise, from which there was no escape. The Mousterian
made not a sound. He did not seem to even
move, but slowly the Castillan giant’s head with
nose and mouth gushing blood, fell back. A dull
crunch, and before the cave-men realized what had
happened, their chieftain was borne to the edge of
the rock-platform and cast down among them, a
bloody, lifeless thing. In a flash, Pic recovered his
ax and was again upon the defensive. The rabble
recoiled in terror from the fierce Lion Man.
Gonch gazed down into the face of the dead Totan.
“Good,” he croaked. “Now for the other,” and
from his safe perch he gave frantic commands for
his minions to renew the attack. “Kill the man!”
he screeched. “Capture the boy alive. He is our
last chance for flints and food. At them, wolves.
A whole tribe will come down upon you if they
escape.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Battle of the Giants</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus urged, the cave-men rallied and rushed
again to the assault. The giant Mousterian’s ax cut
them down like straws, but the living climbed over
the dead and carried the ledge by sheer weight of
numbers. Pic was forced back against the wall,
still fighting furiously, although bleeding from a
dozen wounds. His ax was shattered, but the boy
was ready with another. Pic seized and wielded it
with deadly effect until it too was gone. Then
grappling with the man nearest him, he fastened
his teeth in his throat. The mob surged over him.
Kutnar struggled desperately, but was soon overpowered.</p>

<p>At that moment, a loud snorting and thumping
of heavy feet sounded from below, followed by
squeals of rage, and two monstrous beasts came
charging up the slope. “The Mammoth! the
Woolly Rhinoceros!” yelled the cave-men nearest
them and away they scampered, howling with fear.
The alarm spread like wildfire to their companions
upon the ledge and they too scattered in all directions,
the rearmost barely escaping with their lives.
Even Gonch shared their panic, for he made all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
haste to climb higher, forgetting that he was quite
safe and that no beast could reach him.</p>

<p>Hairi and Wulli halted at the foot of the ledge
and looked about them. The Castillans had fled
and in all of that gore and slaughter, only one semblance
of life remained. Kutnar the boy was kneeling
over a prostrate form and wiping the blood
from its face. The form was that of the Mousterian
weapon maker, lying where it had fallen. The
Castillan jackals had borne down Pic the Lion by
their overwhelming numbers, but were now in their
turn fleeing in disorder along the mountain side.
It had devolved upon the Mammoth and Rhinoceros
to rush to their friends’ assistance and strike
the decisive blow, thereby terminating this most
desperate of unequal conflicts—the bloody battle
of the Scarp.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<h2>XXVII</h2>

<p>It had been a hard, wearisome charge up the
steep mountain slope. Hairi and Wulli wondered
how they ever summoned courage to do
it. They had never done such a thing before.
But the present conditions were extraordinary.
Pic, their dearest friend, was being set upon by
the man-pack and there was no other way to help
him. They had returned after their first fright,
and hearing the voice of battle about them, had
hurried to the rescue. To their horror, they found
the ledge a shambles reeking with blood and death.
Pic was not there. They feared they had come too
late. Then both jumped back in surprise, for
Kutnar was looking down upon them. They recognized
him at once.</p>

<p>“You here?” Wulli gasped. “I am so glad. We
have found you at last.”</p>

<p>“I, too, am glad,” said the Mammoth. “We
have come far to find you. But why should these
men destroy each other? I do not see Pic and am
so afraid. Where is he?”</p>

<p>Kutnar stared at the huge beast like one not in
his right mind. He pointed to the body over which
he kneeled and replied in a hollow voice: “Here
he lies and yet it is not he. The best of him is gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
He tried to save me from these savage men. For
that he died;” and the boy rocked back and forth
over his father’s body, moaning as though his heart
would break.</p>

<p>The Mammoth bowed his head, overwhelmed,
crushed as the terrible truth drove itself home.
“Dead?” he groaned dismally. “I too will stay.
I will not leave him.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said the Rhinoceros solemnly.</p>

<p>All three remained with heads bent low, paying
their last tribute to the Mousterian chief. The
Mammoth was the first to recover himself. He
stamped his feet and flapped his ears. His eyes
reddened like hot coals. “Who killed him?” he
screamed. “If one of these men did it, I will
trample the life out of every one of them, even
though I have to climb over the top of this mountain
to do it.”</p>

<p>Kutnar was on his feet in an instant. “Who
killed him? I do not know. But there is one who
caused all this, my traitor-friend the Hyena Man.
I heard his voice above us. He must die.” He
darted across the ledge and picked up his sling and
pebble-pouch which had fallen there during the
melee, then leaped down the slope and looked above
him. A man was ascending the Scarp. Kutnar
ran to one side of the rock-shelter and began
climbing up.</p>

<p>High above his head, Gonch was ascending leisurely,
feeling comfortable in the thought that
Totan and Pic were no more. He had seen Totan’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
body and would have relished a glimpse of Pic’s
but the Mammoth and Rhinoceros stood on guard
below and he dared not descend. However Pic
was as dead as Totan, he felt reasonably certain
and now that his enemies were out of the way, he
planned to return to Castillo and seize the reins
of authority. Some day, Fate permitting, he might
even venture into the Mousterian country and take
Pic’s place. The possibilities of his future were
unlimited. He might become the foremost potentate
in all the world.</p>

<p>He was looking behind him now and then from
force of habit. There were none left to pursue
him but he had not seen Pic’s body and therefore
could not feel absolutely sure. As he snatched one
of his hurried glances, to his horror, he saw a figure
scaling the cliff below him. For an instant he
thought that the Mousterian chief must have risen
from the grave to destroy him, then he breathed
a sigh of relief. It was not Pic but a much smaller
man. One of his own people perhaps. He halted
until the other came near enough to be recognized.
Gonch stared at him in amazement then snarled
hatefully, “Kutnar! What brings the boy here?”</p>

<p>As if in reply, Kutnar shook his fist at the Muskman
and cried out, “Traitor, you shall not escape
me this time,” and climbed up as fast as he could.</p>

<p>Gonch laughed a loud bitter laugh. The boy
carried no ax and he was at a disadvantage, attacking
from below. The Muskman seized a stone
from the wall behind him and raised it above his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
head in both hands. There he stood howling derision
at his pursuer.</p>

<p>Kutnar heard but he only climbed the faster.
His was a lithe active body. In his brain lurked
the inborn gift of clear-headedness and sure-footedness
working in perfect harmony. But never had
his climbing powers been subjected to so severe a
test. In places the wall, for rods at a time appeared
so smooth and unbroken that it seemed impossible
for a human being to adhere to it; but
Kutnar not only did adhere but continued upward
at an astonishing rate. His toes and fingers found
every minute wrinkle and crevice. His legs were
the sustaining members, his shoulders the windlass,
his arms the tackle of a self-propelling derrick
lifting itself in mid-air. Kutnar was expending
his energy at a lavish rate. He might have rested
temporarily on the occasional rock-shelves that
marked his route. His enemy was resting and he
could have done likewise. In a saner moment he
would have so chosen but now he was insane; a
maniac bearing a death message to the man whose
perfidy had destroyed the one he loved best. The
human derrick was strained almost to the breaking
point and still it continued to propel itself skyward.
Not until Kutnar reached an unusually deep shelf
which gave him more than standing room, did he
pause even for a moment; then he halted and looked
up. The Muskman stood waiting above him.
Kutnar could see his open red mouth and white
teeth. Gonch’s face wore an expression of cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
eagerness such as a panther wears when about to
spring from the tree branches upon a fawn passing
beneath. His back was set against the wall, both
hands raised high above his head. He was preparing
to hurl the stone.</p>

<p>Kutnar braced his legs, secured a firm foothold
and whirled his sling. Gonch trembled. He could
almost feel the pebble striking his skull with deadly
precision. He faltered, tossed the stone wildly
and fled in a panic up the wall behind him. The
boy dodged the stone as it fell but now the Muskman
was beyond effective throwing range and so
Kutnar ceased whirling his sling and followed after.
“The traitor must die,” repeated itself over and
over in his mind and drove out all thought of himself,
a stripling pitted against a full-grown man.
His breath came in gasps, for what with the struggle
below and his exhausting climb, the limit of his
endurance was nearly reached. There came over
him the fear that Gonch might escape after all and
so he strove desperately, forcing his shaking legs
to carry him on.</p>

<p>Gonch was comparatively fresh and perhaps it
was just as well for the boy that he had abandoned
all thought of fight. The Muskman had become
obsessed with fear of the magic sling whose deadly
accuracy he had become familiar with through long
experience. Kutnar’s legs would no longer aid
him in that heart-breaking ascent. The sling
launched its bolt but in his anxiety, he missed his
aim. Gonch was struggling up the slippery rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
when he heard the stone whizz close by his head and
click against the wall. The sounds spurred him on
but in his over-eagerness he slipped and dropped
back several feet. This slip terrified him.</p>

<p>Kutnar felt in his pouch and drew forth another
pebble—the last. He had but one chance left.
He reloaded his weapon but he neither whirled nor
threw at his enemy now moving slowly but surely
to safety. He was waiting until his heart would
ease its pounding and his muscles could be brought
under control for the final cast.</p>

<p>Gonch had recovered himself and was making
progress. No second missile had followed the first
to shake his nerves. Desperation gave him courage
for the supreme effort required. His hands
were raised to within a few yards of the crowning
pinnacles of the Scarp. Once ahold of them he
could drag himself to the top—and safety.</p>

<p>Kutnar saw. His heart had ceased palpitating.
He no longer trembled. His body was as cold as
ice. “That man must die,” he said for the last
time. The thong hissed. Every ounce of strength
in the guiding muscles followed the stone in its
flight and sent it whizzing to the mark.</p>

<p>Gonch doubled up. His feet jerked convulsively
as the death-messenger crashed into his ribs.
His hands had already found anchorage. He
might have pulled himself to the top, had not the
sling-stone bid him halt. His lower limbs half-paralyzed,
dabbed feebly against the smooth wall
in a vain effort to relieve the weight of his body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
thrown suddenly upon his arms. Once, twice,
thrice, his feet sought support, then his muscles relaxed,
his body straightened out and he hung suspended
in mid-air.</p>

<p>Beneath him, his destroyer watched and waited,
cold and implacable as an avenging Fate. The
Muskman yet clung to the coping fluttering like a
wounded bird. Slowly his head fell back and
turned so that he could see over his right shoulder.
His face blanched, his eyes started from their sockets
at sight of the vast emptiness beneath him.
Gradually his grip relaxed. He made a last effort
for one more moment of sweet life, then with a despairing
screech, down he fell. His body shot
along the face of the Scarp until it encountered a
rugged projection which sent it bounding clear of
the rock-wall. Down, down it fell, whirling in
space, finally crashing to its last resting place at
the base of the Scarp. The traitor had come into
his own at last and his body lay amid those of his
comrades who now shared their lot with the true
author of their destruction.</p>

<h2>XXVIII</h2>

<p>How Kutnar descended the precipitous
wall of the Scarp, he never knew nor did
he care. A slip of hand or foot would
have sent him to his death, a thing he
feared not, for it meant only peace and rest to his
aching heart. His motions were those of one imprudent
and entirely heedless of danger. He lowered
his body from one rock projection to another
in such reckless fashion that the wonder is he did
not fall. Some good angel must have been watching
over him. His long journey downward was
entirely without mishap and he reached the foot of
the Scarp in safety.</p>

<p>Here a tremendous surprise awaited him. Pic’s
body had disappeared. In its stead, a man sat
upon the rock-platform with feet dangling over the
edge. His body was bruised and bleeding. His
eyes were closed and his head hung forward upon
his chest. Had not the Mammoth’s trunk curled
around his waist, given him support, he must have
fallen. But he was alive for his muscles twitched
feebly and he mumbled strange words that neither
Hairi nor Wulli could understand.</p>

<p>For an instant, Kutnar stared open-mouthed unable
to realize the great mercy that some good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
spirit had reserved as his portion. “Alive!” he said
in a low voice as though fearing to disturb the dead.
“I am dreaming. It cannot be.”</p>

<p>“Alive, yes he is. Oowee, oowee!” squealed the
Rhinoceros jumping up and down with joy. “And
now you too are safe.”</p>

<p>Kutnar sprang to his father with a glad cry and
threw his arms about him. Pic opened his eyes.
“Kutnar,” he murmured feebly; then his eyes
closed again and he rambled on deliriously about
wolves and hyenas and snow and various other
things that had not the remotest connection with
the present occasion. It was a most unintelligible
discourse but his audience listened with rapt attention
and beamed happily, for it all meant that Pic
was alive.</p>

<p>Yes he still lived, thanks to his great strength
and endurance. But for them, he could not have
survived the terrible battering he had received.
His body was a mass of welts and contusions, the
result of merciless pounding. Scarcely a square
inch of it had been spared by the Castillan clubs.
No man could have lived under a third of those
blows, had they been delivered by flint-axes, which
cleaved through the flesh and inflicted ghastly
wounds. Pic had demonstrated with his own body
that ineffective weapons made not only poor hunters
but poor warriors as well. However he was
not yet out of danger in spite of his having survived
the damage inflicted by his enemies. Bad bruises,
loss of blood and resulting weakness might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
finally put an end to him, had it not been for the
care and treatment bestowed upon him by his
friends.</p>

<p>Hairi found a spring bubbling from the mountain
slope and brought a trunkful, doling it out to
Kutnar who laved his father’s wounds and cooled
his fever. The boy then hurried to the grotto of
the underground vault and returned with Pic’s
bearskin robe. The invalid was bundled up in this
and tucked away under the rock-shelter to rest.
This done, Kutnar went off to re-fill his pebble
pouch and kill food for Pic so that he might eat
when he had rested and regained his strength.
Meanwhile Hairi and Wulli stood guard. When
Kutnar returned, the two beasts descended the
mountain slope to graze and the boy went on duty.
Such nursing could not help but produce results.
Pic recovered rapidly and before many days, the
quartette was ready to depart. Still bundled up in
his bearskin suit, Pic was lifted to the Mammoth’s
neck and with Kutnar sitting behind to steady him,
they marched down the slope and around the mountain
to the River Pas. They crossed this and went
north along the right bank until they came in sight
of Castillo. A faint haze arising in the distance
from the cave-entrance, showed that it was still the
home of men. “What will they do with Totan
and Gonch gone?” said Kutnar, and his father answered,
“Rather what will they do now that they
no longer have a boy to feed them?”</p>

<p>This was the last they saw of the Castillan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
stronghold, for here they turned in the direction of
the rising sun. A long journey lay before them
but their hearts were light and full of joy of companionship.
Kutnar was found, Pic was himself
again and now they were bound for a goal of rest
and contentment—home.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
